Councils have been chartered in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands), [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Germany]], [[Guatemala]], [[Panama]], [[Dominican Republic]], the [[Philippines]], [[Guam]], [[Spain]], [[Japan]], [[Cuba]], and most recently in [[Poland]]<ref>http://www.kofc.org/un/en/officers/fac.html</ref>. The Knights' official junior organization, the [[Columbian Squires]], has over 5,000 Circles. All the Order's [[ceremony|ceremonials]] and business meetings are restricted to members, though all other events are open to the public. A promise not to reveal any details of the ceremonials except to an equally qualified Knight is required to ensure their impact and meaning for new members; an additional clause subordinates the promise to that Knight's civil and religious duties.

In the 2010 fiscal year, the Order gave over US$154 million directly to charity (over $1.406 billion in charitable contributions and 653 million man hours in the last 10 years) and performed over 70 million [[man-hour]]s of voluntary service. Over 413,000 pints of blood were donated.  For their support for the Church and local communities, as well as for their philanthropic efforts, the Order often refers to itself as the "strong right arm of the Church".<ref name="2009 charity">{{cite journal | title=Keeping Father McGivney's Promise| journal=Knightline| year=July 2010| volume=27| issue=7| page=1}}</ref> The Order's insurance program has more than $80 billion of life insurance policies in force, backed up by $15.5 billion in assets, and holds the highest insurance ratings given by [[A. M. Best]] and the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association,<ref>http://www.imsaethics.org</ref> though Standard & Poor's downgraded the program to AA+ in August 2011<ref>http://www.cnbc.com/id/44058747</ref> along with the United States government.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245316596970 | title = Rating Actions Taken On 10 U.S.-Based Insurance Groups Following Sovereign Downgrade | accessdate = 2012-06-28 | date = 8 Aug 2011 | publisher = [[Standard & Poor's]]}}</ref>
