Young & R.A. Freedman, ''University Physics with Modern Physics'': 11th Edition: International Edition (2004), Addison Wesley. Chapter 1, section 1.1, page 2 has this to say: "Physics is an ''experimental'' science. Physicists observe the phenomena of nature and try to find patterns and principles that relate these phenomena. These patterns are called physical theories or, when they are very well established and of broad use, physical laws or principles." </br> Steve Holzner, ''Physics for Dummies'' (2006), Wiley. Chapter 1, page 7 says: "Physics is the study of your world and the world and universe around you."

However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the [[cosmos]] or the [[world (philosophy)|philosophical world]].</ref>
