The '''Kingdom of Saudi Arabia''' is the largest country on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It borders [[Jordan]] on the north, [[Iraq]] on the north and north-east, [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] on the east, [[Oman]] on the south and south-east, and [[Yemen]] on the south, with the [[Persian Gulf]] to its north-east and the [[Red Sea]] to its west. It is called "the land of the two holy mosques", a reference to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], [[Islam]]'s two holiest places.

==History==
{{Main|History of Saudi Arabia}}

The Saudi state began in central Arabia in about 1750. A regional ruler, [[Muhammad bin Saud]], joined forces with an Islamic reformer, [[Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab|Muhammad Abd Al-Wahhab]], to create a new political entity. Over the next one hundred and fifty years, the fortunes of the Saud family rose and fell several times as Saudi rulers contended with Egypt, the [[Ottoman Empire]], and other Arabian families for control on the peninsula. The modern Saudi state was founded by the late King [[Abdul Aziz Al-Saud]] (known internationally as Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud).

In [[1902]] Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud captured [[Riyadh]], the Al-Saud dynasty's ancestral capital, from the rival [[Rashidi|Al-Rashid]] family. Continuing his conquests, Abdul Aziz subdued [[Al-Ahsa]], [[Al-Qatif]], the rest of [[Najd]], and the [[Hijaz]] between [[1913]] and [[1926]]. On [[8 January]] [[1926]] Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud became the King of Hijaz. On [[29 January]] [[1927]] he took the title King of Najd (his previous Najdi title was Sultan). By the [[Treaty of Jedda]], signed on [[May 20]], [[1927]], the [[United Kingdom]] recognized the independence of Abdul Aziz's realm, then known as the Kingdom of Hijaz and Nejd. In [[1932]], these regions were unified as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The discovery of [[petroleum | oil]] in March [[1938]] transformed the country economically, and has given the kingdom great legitimacy over the years.

Besides [[Liechtenstein]], Saudi Arabia remains the only country in the world whose common English name includes that of its ruling family. Many opponents of the [[House of Saud]] reject the family's legitimacy and decline to speak of the country as "Saudi Arabia".

{{Main|Politics of Saudi Arabia}}
The central institution of Saudi Arabian Government is the [[Saudi monarchy]]. The Basic Law adopted in 1992 declared that Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by the sons and grandsons of the first king, [[Abd Al Aziz Al Saud]], and that the [[Qur'an]] is the [[constitution]] of the country, which is governed on the basis of Islamic law ([[Shari'a]]).

There are no recognized political parties or national elections. The king is often classified as an [[absolute monarch]], but his powers are theoretically limited within the bounds of Shari'a and other Saudi traditions. He also must retain a consensus of the Saudi royal family, religious leaders (ulema), and other important elements in Saudi society. The state's ideology is [[Salafi]]. This flavour of [[Islam]] spreads further by funding construction of mosques and [[Qur'an schools]] around the world. The leading members of the royal family choose the king from among themselves with the subsequent approval of the ulema.

Saudi kings have gradually developed a central government. Since 1953, the Council of Ministers, appointed by and responsible to the king, has advised on the formulation of general policy and directed the activities of the growing bureaucracy. This council consists of a prime minister, the first and second deputy prime ministers, 20 ministers (of whom the minister of defense also is the second deputy prime minister), two ministers of state, and a small number of advisers and heads of major autonomous organizations.

Legislation is by resolution of the Council of Ministers, ratified by royal decree, and must be compatible with the Shari'a (Islamic law). Justice is administered according to the Shari'a by a system of religious courts whose judges are appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Supreme Judicial Council, composed of 12 senior jurists. The independence of the judiciary is protected by law. The king acts as the highest court of appeal and has the power to pardon.  Access to high officials (usually at a majlis, or public audience) and the right to petition them directly are well-established traditions.

[[Saudi Arabia municipal elections, 2005|Saudi Municipal elections]] took place in 2005 and some commentators saw this a first tentative step towards the intoduction of [[democratic]] processes in the Kingdom, including the legalisation of political parties. Other analysts of the Saudi political scene were more sceptical. See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4252079.stm].

Saudi courts impose [[capital punishment]] and [[corporal punishment]], including [[amputation]]s of hands and feet for serious [[robbery]], and [[flogging]]s for lesser crimes such as "sexual deviance" (e.g. homosexuality) and drunkenness. The number of lashes is not clearly prescribed by law and varies according to the discretion of the presiding judges. The number ranges from dozens to several thousand, usually applied over a period of weeks or months. In 2002, the United Nations Committee against Torture criticised Saudi Arabia over the amputations and floggings it carries out under the Shari'a. The Saudi delegation responded defending "legal traditions" held since the inception of Islam in the region 1400 years ago and rejected interference in its legal system. (Source: BBC, see [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=saudi+torture&btnG=Google+Search])

Religious police enforce a modest code of dress and many institutions from schools to ministries are gender-segregated. [[Homosexual]] men and women are prosecuted (sometimes publicly) and/or executed, if they are found to be engaging in same-sex sexual activities.

==Provinces==
[[image:SaudiArabiaNumbered.png|right|Provinces of Saudi Arabia]]{{Main|Provinces of Saudi Arabia}}

Saudi Arabia is divided into 13 provinces (manatiq, singular - mintaqah).

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Saudi Arabia}}

[[image:Sa-map.png|right|Map of Saudi Arabia]]
The kingdom occupies eighty percent of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Yemen are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government's estimate is 2,217,949 square kilometers (856,355 [[square mile|mi²]]). Other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 square kilometers (830,000 mi²) and 2,240,000 square kilometers (864,869 mi²). 

The climate is dry and hot. Dry desert with great extremes of temperature and the terrain is mostly uninhabited, sandy desert. In most parts of the country, vegetation is limited to weeds, xerophytic herbs and shrubs. Animals include the ibex, wildcats, baboons, wolves, and hyenas in the highlands. Small birds are found in the oases. The coastal area of the [[Red Sea]], especially the [[coral reef]]s, have a rich marine [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]]. Saudi Arabia has a coastline of 2,640 kilometers (1,640 [[mile|mi]]).

Saudi Arabia consists mostly of semi-desert and desert with oases. Almost half of the total country is uninhabitable desert with annual precipitation up to 100 millimetres (4 [[inch|in]]) in most regions. The western regions are plateau and the east is lowland. The southwest region has mountains as high as 3,000 metres (9,840 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), and is an area is known for greenest and freshest climate in all of the country. The capital, Riyadh, which is to the center-east has an average temperature in July of 42ºC (108°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) and 14ºC (57°F) in January. In contrast, [[Jeddah]] on the western coast has 31ºC (88°F) in July and 23ºC (73°F) in January. 

Less than 2 % of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty [[desert]]s, such as the [[Rub' al Khali]] (desert), the [[Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian xeric shrublands]]. There are no permanent rivers and lakes in Saudi Arabia.

==Economy==

[[Image:On the Dhahran-Al Khobar Highway.jpg|thumb|On the Dhahran-Al Khobar Highway]]
{{Main|Economy of Saudi Arabia}} ''Also: [[Oil boom]] (1974-85)''

Saudi Arabia has an [[petroleum|oil]]-based economy with strong government controls over major economic activities. Saudi Arabia is known to be in possession of 260.1 billion barrels of oil reserves as of 2003, about 24% of the world's proven total petroleum reserves. It ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum and plays a leading role in [[OPEC]]. Moreover, the proven reserves increase gradually as more oil fields are discovered, unlike most other oil-producing countries. The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 75% of budget revenues, 40% of the GDP, and 90% of export earnings. About 35% of the GDP comes from the private sector. Saudi Arabia was a key player in the successful efforts of OPEC and other oil producing countries to raise the price of oil in [[1999]] to its highest level since the [[Gulf War]] by reducing production. Saudi Arabia announced plans to begin privatizing the electricity companies in [[1999]], which followed the ongoing privatization of the telecommunications company. The government is expected to continue calling for private sector growth to lessen the kingdom's dependence on oil and increase employment opportunities for the swelling Saudi population. Shortages of water and rapid population growth may constrain government efforts to increase self-sufficiency in agricultural products.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has experienced a significant contraction of oil revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income has fallen from $25,000 in [[1980]] to $8,000 in [[2003]], up from about $7,000 in [[1999]]. The decline in inflation-adjusted per-capita income from 1980 to 1999 set a record, being by far the worst such decline suffered by any nation-state in history.

Recently, with higher oil prices, however, Saudi Arabia's oil revenues have increased dramatically. Saudi Arabia's budget surplus has crossed $28 billion (SR110 billion) in 2005. The Tadawul (The Saudi stock market Index) (TASI) finished 2004 with a massive 76.23 % to close at 4437.58 points. Market capitalization was up 110.14 % from a year earlier to stand at $157.3 billion (SR589.93 billion), which makes it the biggest stock market in the [[Middle East]].‏

Saudi Arabia officially became a [[WTO]] member in December 2005.
===Foreign labor===
{{Main|Human trafficking in Saudi Arabia}}

Saudi Arabia is a destination for men and women from South and East Asia and East Africa seeking work. Hundreds of thousands of low-skilled workers from third world regions migrate voluntarily to Saudi Arabia. A minority of these immigrants are [[human trafficking|trafficked]] for the purpose of labor exploitation, [[begging]], or [[involuntary servitude]].

==Demographics==
[[Image:Hills2.jpg|thumb|Townhouses in the Hills of Dharan]]
{{Main|Demographics of Saudi Arabia}}

Saudi Arabia's 2003 population is estimated to be about 24.3 million, including about 6.4 million resident foreigners. Until the [[1960s]], most of the population was [[nomadic]] or semi-nomadic; due to rapid economic and urban growth, more than 95% of the population now is settled. The birth rate is 29.74 births per 1,000 people. The death rate is only 2.66 deaths per 1,000 people. Some cities and oases have densities of more than 1,000 people per square kilometre (2,600 /mi²).

Most Saudis are ethnically [[Arab]]. Some are of mixed ethnic origin and are descended from [[Turkey|Turks]], [[Iran]]ians, [[Malays]], and others, most of whom immigrated as pilgrims and reside in the [[Hijaz]] region along the [[Red Sea]] coast. Many Arabs from nearby countries are employed in the kingdom. There also are significant numbers of [[South Asia|South]] and [[South East Asia]]n [[expatriate]]s mostly from [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Indonesia]], and the [[Philippines]]. There are around 100,000 [[Westerners]] in Saudi Arabia, most of which live in [[Compound (fortification)|compound]]s. 

According to the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Fact Book]], 100% of Saudi Arabias [[Citizenship|citizens]] are [[Muslim]]s. [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sa.html#People]

The exit and entry visa cards ask applicants for their religious affiliation and officially bans entry to [[atheist]]s, [[Israelis]] or anyone with an official stamp from the State of [[Israel]].

*[[Music of Saudi Arabia]]
*[[Islam in Saudi Arabia]]

Saudi Arabian culture revolves almost entirely around the religion of [[Islam]]. Islam's two holiest sites, [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], are located in the country. Every day, five times a day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which dot the country. The weekend consists of Thursday and Friday. Islam itself derives from the same monotheistic roots as [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]],  and traditionally Muslims generally regarded other religions with respect. [[Jew]]s and [[Christian]]s are considered fellow [[People of the Book]]. However the public practice of Christianity, the presence of churches and open possession of Christian religious materials are outlawed in Saudi Arabia. Israelis are also banned from entering the country. Islam's holy book the [[Qur'an]] is Saudi Arabia's constitution, and [[Shari'ah]] (Islamic law) is the foundation of its legal system. See [[Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia]]

One of Saudi Arabia's most compelling folk rituals is the [[Ardha]], the country's national dance. This sword dance is based on ancient [[Bedouin]] traditions: drummers beat out a rhythm and a poet chants verses while sword-carrying men dance shoulder to shoulder. [[Al-sihba]] folk music, from the [[Hijaz]], has its origins in Arab [[Andalusia]], a region of medieval [[Spain]]. In [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Jeddah]], dance and song incorporate the sound of the [[al-mizmar]], an [[oboe]]-like woodwind instrument. The [[drum]] is also an important instrument according to traditional and tribal customs.

Saudi Arabian dress is strongly symbolic, representing the people's ties to the land, the past, and Islam. The predominantly loose and flowing, but covering garments reflect the practicalities of life in a desert country as well as Islam's emphasis on conservative dress. Traditionally, men usually wear an ankle-length shirt woven from wool or cotton (known as a [[thawb]]), with a [[shimagh]] (a large checkered square of cotton held in place by a cord coil) or a [[ghutra]](a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by a cord coil) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a camel-hair cloak ([[bisht]]) over the top. Women's clothes are decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques. However, Saudi women must wear a long cloak ([[abaya]]) and veil ([[niqab]]) when they leave the house to protect their modesty. The law does not apply to foreigners at such a high degree, but both men and women are told to dress modestly.

Islam forbids the eating of [[pork]] and the drinking of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], and this law is followed strictly throughout Saudi Arabia. Arabic unleavened bread, or [[khobz]], is eaten with almost all meals. Other staples include cooked lamb, grilled [[chicken]], [[felafel]] (deep-fried [[chickpea]] balls), [[shwarma]] (spit-cooked sliced [[lamb]]), and [[fuul]] (a paste of [[fava bean]]s, [[garlic]] and [[lemon]]). Traditional [[coffee]] houses used to be ubiquitous, but are now being displaced by food-hall style cafes. Arabic tea is also a famous custom, which is used in both casual and formal meetings between friends, family and even strangers. The tea is black (without milk) and has herbal flavoring that comes in many variations.

Public theatres and cinemas are prohibited, as [[Wahabbi]] tradition deems those institutions to be incompatible with [[Islam]]. However, in private compounds such as [[Dhahran]] and [[Ras Tanura]] public theaters can be found, but often are more popular for local music, arts, and theatre productions rather than the exhibition of motion pictures. Recently plans for some cinemas that will allow Arabic cartoons to be featured in cinemas for women and children were announced.

The cultural heritage is celebrated at the annual [[Jenadriyah]] Cultural festival.

An institution found in Saudi Arabia is the [[Mutaween]], or religious police, also known as the ''Authority for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice''. There are 3,500 officers assisted by thousands of volunteers, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2399885.stm] whose job it is to enforce religious doctrine (Muslim [[Shari'a]] law as defined by the Saudi government) and to root out "un-Islamic" activities. They have the power to arrest any unrelated males and females caught socializing, and to ban consumer products and media, such as games and toys, various Western musical groups, and television shows. The Mutaween recently launched a website where people can file anonymous tips about "un-Islamic" activities.

On [[March 11]], [[2002]] the Mutaween prevented [[schoolgirl]]s from escaping from their burning school in [[Mecca]] because the girls were not wearing headscarves and ''abayas'' (black robes). Fifteen girls died and 50 were injured as a result. There was widespread public criticism, and the Saudi government and religious leaders condemned the Mutaween for their actions. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1874471.stm]. Although their influence and power has declined recently, they had been the focus of a few human rights concerns.
