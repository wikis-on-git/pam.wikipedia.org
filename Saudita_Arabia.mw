The '''Kingdom of Saudi Arabia''' is the largest country on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It borders [[Jordan]] on the north, [[Iraq]] on the north and north-east, [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] on the east, [[Oman]] on the south and south-east, and [[Yemen]] on the south, with the [[Persian Gulf]] to its north-east and the [[Red Sea]] to its west. It is called "the land of the two holy mosques", a reference to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], [[Islam]]'s two holiest places.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Saudi Arabia}}

[[image:Sa-map.png|right|Map of Saudi Arabia]]
The kingdom occupies eighty percent of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Yemen are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government's estimate is 2,217,949 square kilometers (856,355 [[square mile|mi²]]). Other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 square kilometers (830,000 mi²) and 2,240,000 square kilometers (864,869 mi²). 

The climate is dry and hot. Dry desert with great extremes of temperature and the terrain is mostly uninhabited, sandy desert. In most parts of the country, vegetation is limited to weeds, xerophytic herbs and shrubs. Animals include the ibex, wildcats, baboons, wolves, and hyenas in the highlands. Small birds are found in the oases. The coastal area of the [[Red Sea]], especially the [[coral reef]]s, have a rich marine [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]]. Saudi Arabia has a coastline of 2,640 kilometers (1,640 [[mile|mi]]).

Saudi Arabia consists mostly of semi-desert and desert with oases. Almost half of the total country is uninhabitable desert with annual precipitation up to 100 millimetres (4 [[inch|in]]) in most regions. The western regions are plateau and the east is lowland. The southwest region has mountains as high as 3,000 metres (9,840 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), and is an area is known for greenest and freshest climate in all of the country. The capital, Riyadh, which is to the center-east has an average temperature in July of 42ºC (108°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) and 14ºC (57°F) in January. In contrast, [[Jeddah]] on the western coast has 31ºC (88°F) in July and 23ºC (73°F) in January. 

Less than 2 % of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty [[desert]]s, such as the [[Rub' al Khali]] (desert), the [[Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian xeric shrublands]]. There are no permanent rivers and lakes in Saudi Arabia.

{{Main|Economy of Saudi Arabia}} ''Also: [[Oil boom]] (1974-85)''

Saudi Arabia has an [[petroleum|oil]]-based economy with strong government controls over major economic activities. Saudi Arabia is known to be in possession of 260.1 billion barrels of oil reserves as of 2003, about 24% of the world's proven total petroleum reserves. It ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum and plays a leading role in [[OPEC]]. Moreover, the proven reserves increase gradually as more oil fields are discovered, unlike most other oil-producing countries. The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 75% of budget revenues, 40% of the GDP, and 90% of export earnings. About 35% of the GDP comes from the private sector. Saudi Arabia was a key player in the successful efforts of OPEC and other oil producing countries to raise the price of oil in [[1999]] to its highest level since the [[Gulf War]] by reducing production. Saudi Arabia announced plans to begin privatizing the electricity companies in [[1999]], which followed the ongoing privatization of the telecommunications company. The government is expected to continue calling for private sector growth to lessen the kingdom's dependence on oil and increase employment opportunities for the swelling Saudi population. Shortages of water and rapid population growth may constrain government efforts to increase self-sufficiency in agricultural products.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has experienced a significant contraction of oil revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income has fallen from $25,000 in [[1980]] to $8,000 in [[2003]], up from about $7,000 in [[1999]]. The decline in inflation-adjusted per-capita income from 1980 to 1999 set a record, being by far the worst such decline suffered by any nation-state in history.

Recently, with higher oil prices, however, Saudi Arabia's oil revenues have increased dramatically. Saudi Arabia's budget surplus has crossed $28 billion (SR110 billion) in 2005. The Tadawul (The Saudi stock market Index) (TASI) finished 2004 with a massive 76.23 % to close at 4437.58 points. Market capitalization was up 110.14 % from a year earlier to stand at $157.3 billion (SR589.93 billion), which makes it the biggest stock market in the [[Middle East]].‏

Saudi Arabia officially became a [[WTO]] member in December 2005.
