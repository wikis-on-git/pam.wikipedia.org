== History ==
While some [[analogue electronics|analogue]] mobile phones provided a standard [[RJ11, RJ14, RJ25|RJ11]] telephone socket into which a normal landline modem could be plugged, this only provided slow [[dial-up]] connections, usually 2.4 kilobit per second (kbit/s) or less. The next generation of phones, known as 2G (for 'second generation'), were digital, and offered faster dial-up speeds of 9.6kbit/s or 14.4kbit/s without the need for a separate modem. A further evolution called HSCSD used multiple GSM channels (two or three in each direction) to support up to 43.2kbit/s. All of these technologies still required their users to have a dial-up [[Internet service provider|ISP]] to connect to and provide the Internet access - it was not provided by the mobile phone network itself.

The release of [[2.5G]] phones with support for [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] data changed this. The 2.5G networks break both digital voice and data into small chunks, and mix both onto the network simultaneously in a process called [[packet switching]]. This allows the phone to have a voice connection and a data connection at the same time, rather than a single channel that has to be used for one or the other. The network can link the data connection into a company network, but for most users the connection is to the Internet. This allows web browsing on the phone, but a PC can also tap in to this service if it connects to the phone. The PC needs to send a special telephone number to the phone to get access to the packet data connection. From the PC's viewpoint, the connection still looks like a normal PPP dial-up link, but it is all terminating on the phone, which then handles the exchange of data with the network. Speeds on 2.5G networks are usually in the 30–50kbit/s range.

[[3G]] networks have taken this approach to a higher level, using different underlying technology but the same principles. They routinely provide speeds over 300kbit/s. Due to the now increased internet speed, internet connection sharing via [[Wireless LAN|WLAN]] has become a workable reality. A particularly popular project has been the Stomp Box, which is a router which shares GPRS internet access via WiFi.<ref>[http://www.stompboxnetworks.com/intro.html The StompBox project]</ref>

A further evolution is the [[3.5G]] technology [[HSDPA]], which has the capacity to provide speeds of multiple [[Megabits per second]].

WiMax has now also been announced, which will allow internet connection sharing over [[WAN]]s (being region-wide, as opposed to local with WiFi), effectively perhaps eliminating the need of wireless modems. This, of course, only in areas where WiMax is to be introduced (eg cities).

==Account hacking==
In order to obtain completely free internet access anywhere in range of GPRS transmitters (of certain providers), some people{{Who|date=March 2009}} have found several hacks.

For example there has been a known hack with an [[Airtel]] prepaid card.<ref>[http://www.theanand.com/blog/index.php/just-ripples/airtel-hack-free-gprs/ Airtel hack]</ref> Also, some companies such as BSNL and Vodafone have flaws in their servers, allowing to use their GPRS network for free.<ref>[http://www.techtalkz.com/tips-n-tricks/5037-bsnl-free-gprs-internet-hack.html BSNL hack]</ref><ref>[http://www.hungry-hackers.com/2008/09/vodafone-gprs-hacked.html Vodafone free GPRS hack]</ref> Also, a special tactic involving the [[ping]]ing of the servers of GPRS providers also allows the obtaining of an IP address which can then be used to use their network.<ref>[http://gsmhosting.com/vbb/archive/index.php/t-271667.html Pinging of WISP's]</ref>
