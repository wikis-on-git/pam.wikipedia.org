'''Diosdado Macapagal International Airport''' ('''DMIA'''), also called '''Clark International Airport''' {{Airport codes|CRK|RPLC}}, is the main airport serving the immediate vicinity of the [[Clark Special Economic Zone]] (CSEZ) and the general area of [[Angeles City]] in the [[Philippines]].

It is located on an area of the CSEZ formerly used as the airfield of the [[Clark Air Base]], which was closed down in [[1991]] by the [[U.S. Air Force]] after the explosion of [[Mount Pinatubo]], subsequently cleaned up, then reopened as the CSEZ. 

The airport is a hub of [[Asian Spirit]] and [[South East Asian Airlines]] and serves as an alternate to its counterpart in [[Manila]], [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]], which was deemed by some of the airlines serving this airport to have higher landing fees.

The airport is managed by the [[Clark International Airport Corporation]] (CIAC), a government-owned and/or controlled corporation.
