"Jess is riding on the crest of mainstream accolade, a feat that validates the common knowledge that Filipino animators are among the best in Hollywood,"" according to Casuco.

"A lot of Filipino artists are in the cutting edge of the animation industry. I guess I am lucky that I worked with The Simpsons," Casuco quoted Espanola as saying.

It was learned that Espanola also got involved in an animation project that won an Emmy. He was the assistant director for Futurama, an animated show that won an Emmy in 2002. Unfortunately, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences did not include the assistant director in the nomination process then.

Espanola, who was given permanent US residency status as a "person with exceptional ability," has an equally compelling life story.

Raised by a single mother in a depressed area in Lubao town, Espanola used his artistic talent to survive when he came face to face with hunger.

"I experienced real hunger when I was a boy. There was no food on the table most of the time. Sometimes I just imagine I already ate. It was a hard life," Espanola reportedly said.

Amazingly, despite the great odds, Jess still remained on top of his class, and people started helping him out when they noticed that he was an exceptionally talented kid. He was among the high-achieving students in high school who gained scholarships at the University of the Philippines.

When Hanna Barbera put up Fil-Cartoon, Inc., its subsidiary outfit in Pasig, Metro Manila, he was hired as a team supervisor and lead animator. His works were, and still are, considered standards of excellence in Philippine animation.

Espanola and his family moved to Los Angeles, California in 1994. (IOF)
