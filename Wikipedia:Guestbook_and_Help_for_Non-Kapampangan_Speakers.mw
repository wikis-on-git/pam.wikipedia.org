== Monuments of Spain Challenge ==
Excuse me for not speaking Kapampangan yet.

[[:es:Wikimedia España|Wikimedia España]] invites you to join the Monuments of Spain Challenge. And what’s that? It’s a contest. You have to edit, translate or expand articles about the Spanish monuments and you will be granted points. So you’re not just writing about wonderful buildings: you can get prizes!

The time of the contest will include all October and any information you may need is [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Monuments_of_Spain_Challenge/en right here].

Join in and good luck!

PS: We would be grateful if you could translate this note into Kapampangan.
