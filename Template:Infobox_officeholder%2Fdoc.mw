==Usage==
Paste the code for the relevant office and then add the [[#Personal data|personal data]] to the bottom. There are no required fields and some fields will not appear when others are in use. For instructions on how to implement multiple terms, see [[Template:Infobox officeholder/example#Multiple terms|this page]]. For advice on alt text, see ''[[Wikipedia:Alternative text for images]]''.

The parameter {{para|order}} is used in conjunction with {{para|office}} to state that the officeholder is the ''n''th holder of the office, for example "2nd President of Mauritius". If {{para|order}} is not specified, the value of {{para|office}} can be [[Help:Link#Wikilinks|wikilinked]] in the usual way, for example, "<tt><nowiki>[[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Minister for Defence]]</nowiki></tt>". However, if {{para|order}} is specified together with {{para|office}}, the value of {{para|office}} is automatically linked to a Wikipedia article of the same name, whether such an article exists or not. Wikilinking cannot be used to redirect the link elsewhere, but a [[Wikipedia:Piped link|piped link]] can be created like this: "<tt><nowiki>Ministry of Defence (Singapore){{!}}Minister for Defence</nowiki></tt>" (note that the double square brackets have been omitted).

When both a start and an end term are given, you can instead specify the complete term using using the parameters {{para|term}}, {{para|terms2}}, etc. This can be helpful with complicated terms that cannot be given as simple starting or ending dates, or if you prefer something other than the default term separator (an en dash, with spaces around it if the start or end is not a simple integer date).
