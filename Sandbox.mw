Founded on July 11, 1946 by James Lindenberg as Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC), it was incorporated as the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation on February 1, 1967, shorted to simply ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010. The common shares of ABS were first offered in July 1992 while the PDR (Philippine Depository Receipt) of ABSP were offered in October 1999.<ref name="ir.abs-cbn.com">{{Citation|title=Shareholders FAQS|url=http://ir.abs-cbn.com/ir/shareholderfaqs.aspx|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref>

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:BolinaoElectronicsCorporation.png|thumb|150px|left|The logo of the Bolinao Electronics Corporation (1946-1952).]]
The nucleus of ABS-CBN Corporation began in 1946 with Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). BEC was established by James Lindenberg, now dubbed as the father of Philippine television,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbn.com/headlines/Article/3285/Farewell-to-the-Father-of-Philippine-Television.aspx |title=Farewell to the Father of Philippine Television |publisher=ABS-CBN.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-08}}</ref> an American electronics engineer who went into radio equipment assembly and radio broadcasting. At that time, the largest media company was [[Manila Broadcasting Company|Manila Broadcasting]], with [[DZRH]] as the leading radio station. In 1949, James Lindenberg shifted Bolinao to radio broadcasting with DZBC and masterminded [[Timeline of the introduction of television in countries|the introduction of television to the country in 1953]].<ref name="history">{{cite web|last=Anastacio|first=Ellen Joy|last2=Badiola|first2=Janine Natalie|title=The History of Philippine Television|url=http://pinoytv.blogspot.com/|publisher=''[[University of the Philippines|UP-CMC Broadcast Department]]''|date=1 January 2010|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref>

In 1951, Lindenberg partnered with Antonio Quirino, brother of then Philippine President Elpidio Quirino, in order to try their hand at television broadcasting. In 1952, BEC was renamed as Alto Broadcasting System or ABS. "Alto" was a contraction of Quirino’s and his wife’s first names, Tony and Aleli. Though they had little money and resources, ABS was able to put up its TV tower by July 1953 and import 300 television sets. The initial test broadcasts began on September of the same year. The very first full-blown broadcast, however, was on 23 October 1953, of a party in Tony Quirino's home. The television station was known as [[DWWX-TV|DZAQ-TV]].<ref name="history"/>

===Merger===
[[File:abscbn60s.svg|150px|thumb|left|ABS-CBN logo (Feb. 1, 1967–Sept. 21, 1972).]]
In turn, on September 24, 1956, the Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) was organized. The network was owned by Don Eugenio Lopez, Sr. and the then Philippine Vice President Fernando Lopez. The following year, Don Eugenio acquired ABS from Quirino and Lindenberg. However, it was only on 1 February 1967 that the corporate name was changed to ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation to reflect the merger (before it was named ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, the name was reverted to the precursor of the network, Bolinao Electronics Corporation or BEC, but the ABS-CBN brand was first used in 1961). In 1958 the network's new headquarters at Roxas Boulevard was inaugurated, and all radio and television operations were consolidated into its two buildings, the radio stations at the Chronicle Building at Aduana Street, [[Intramuros]], [[Manila]], and the TV operations at the brand new Roxas Boulevard building in [[Pasay City]].<ref name="history"/>

In the late 1950s, Don Eugenio's son, [[Eugenio Lopez, Jr.|Geny Lopez]] saw the potential of TV to reach and link Filipinos across the archipelago. By the mid-1960s, the ABS network was leading the radio industry, with stations like [[DZMM|DZXL]] and [[DZMM|DZAQ]] Radyo Patrol, which featured journalists like [[Ernie Baron]], Bong Lapira, Orly Mercado, [[Joe Taruc]], Mario Garcia, Bobby Guanzon, and [[Rey Langit]]. ABS also made breakthroughs in the TV industry by achieving the country's first color TV broadcast, first satellite feed, and first use of videotape, among others. It featured top shows then, such as ''Your Evening with Pilita'' and ''Tawag ng Tanghalan'', the country's first comedy show ''Buhay Artista'', first Philippine gameshow, ''What's My Living'' and the first noontime show ''[[Student Canteen]]'', among others.<ref name="history"/>

On June 14, 1961, [[Eugenio Lopez, Jr.]] built the first provincial TV station in [[Cebu]] airing 4 hours with the tallest tower (in that time) in Cebu measuring 216 feet.

Two years later, the network's first test color broadcasts began. Color broadcasts started in November 1966, the first in the Philippines and Southeast Asia as the network was tagged as the ''[[Timeline of the introduction of color television in countries|First in Color Television]]'', with full color broadcasting beginning in 1971 at all national television stations.<ref name="history"/>

On December 18, 1968, ABS-CBN opened its new Broadcast Center on Bohol Avenue, [[Quezon City]], where it still stands today. At the time, it was the most advanced facility of its kind in Asia. The station again made breakthroughs by using the first live satellite transmissions from abroad, foremost of which was the [[first moon landing]] in 1969 and in the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico]] the year before. The network enjoyed a big portion of the ratings and won various awards and recognitions from different organizations.<ref name="history"/>

In 1970, the network owned and operated 2 national television networks and 5 regional television stations, 7 national radio and 12 regional radio stations nationwide.

===Martial law era===
The station suffered a setback upon the declaration of [[martial law]]. On midnight of 22 September 1972, a day after the declaration of Martial Law, ABS-CBN and its affiliate stations were seized. Geny Lopez, the president of the company, was imprisoned and held without trial for five years until he and his cellmate [[Sergio Osmeña III]] launched a daring jailbreak in 1977 and sought asylum in the [[United States]]. The network itself was taken over by Roberto Benedicto, a presidential crony, who used the Broadcasting Center at Bohol Avenue, then renamed as "Broadcast Plaza", as the home of [[People's Television Network|MBS-4]].<ref name="history"/> Channel 2 would later be relaunched as the [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation|BBC-2]], with a completely new logo, slogan and a theme song from [[Jose Mari Chan]] entitled "Big Beautiful Country" and sung by various artists. BBC-2 later moved to new headquarters in [[Broadcast City]] (also in Diliman, Quezon City) in 1978.

===Capture of Broadcast Plaza (MBS-4)===
At the height of the [[People Power Revolution]], military reformists, believing that television would be a powerful tool to aid the revolution, attacked and took over the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center. On 24 February 1986, former ABS-CBN talents put the station back on the air and televised the drama of the unfolding uprising, thereby contributing to the strength of the revolt.<ref name="history"/>

===Rebirth and growth===
[[File:Abscbn80s.svg|150px|thumb|right|ABS-CBN logo (July 14, 1986 - December 31, 1999)]]
On 28 February 1986, after the Revolution, Geny Lopez returned to the country after self-exile in the United States and started rebuilding from what was left of the station. Recovery was difficult and resources were low, hence, former ABS-CBN employee Freddie M. García was brought in to rework the station's programming. By 1988, ABS-CBN had regained its foothold in Philippine TV ratings.

On 1 March 1987, Channel 2 was relaunched with the live musical special, ''The Star Network: Ang Pagbabalík Ng Bituin'' (The Return of the Star) which noted for the then-brand-new numerical white tri-ribbon channel 2 logo with a white rhombidal star (from 1988 to 1992 the ribbons were tri-coloured in red, green and blue) as a centerpiece of the network's revival. Within the year, ABS-CBN also beefed up its news programmes with ''[[TV Patrol]]'', anchored by a team of [[news presenter|newsreaders]] composed of now former [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice-President]] [[Noli de Castro]], [[Mel Tiangco]], [[Frankie Evangelista]], and Angelique Lazo, with the late [[Ernie Baron]] telling the daily weather forecast. Other reputable news programmes followed, such as ''[[Magandang Gabi, Bayan]]'' and ''[[Hoy Gising!]]''.  The entertainment programmes of ABS-CBN were also revamped with series that previously aired on [[RPN-9]] and [[IBC-13]]: (''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'', ''[[Okey Ka Fairy Ko!]]'', ''[[The Sharon Cuneta Show]]'', ''[[Coney Reyes on Camera]]'') while producing original content (''The Maricel Soriano Drama Special'', ''[[Palibhasa Lalake]]'', ''[[Home Along Da Riles]]'').  Another feature of its return to the top of the ratings is the introduction of the live-action [[sentai]] and [[tokusatsu]] show formats (with ''[[Bioman]]'' and ''[[Shaider]]'') to Philippine television. Filipino-dubbed [[anime]] programmes, another network and Philippine television first, would only begin in the transition to the 1990s.

In 1989, ABS-CBN shifted to satellite broadcast, enabling the entire country to watch the same programmes simultaneously. This was also the very year when the network began international broadcasts to [[Guam]] and [[Saipan]], [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Marianas]], also via satellite, yet another first for Philippine and Asian television. Slowly, the station inched its way to financial recovery, which it achieved by 1990, regularly garnering around 70% of the market.

According to their website, they reach 97% of all households in the country and provide content for Studio 23 on UHF and for 9 cable channels.
On 27 May 2010, the conglomerate dropped the word "Broadcasting" from its corporate name.

===Expansion===
Aside from its flagship broadcast television network [[ABS-CBN]], the company broadcasts to many [[Overseas Filipino|Filipino expatriates]] around the world through [[The Filipino Channel]]. The company has also diversified into film production ([[Star Cinema|ABS-CBN Film Productions, Inc.]]), music production ([[Star Records|Star Recording, Inc.]]), visual effects ([[Roadrunner Network, Inc.]]) print publication ([[ABS-CBN Publishing, Inc.]]),  and new media ([[ABS-CBN Interactive]]). In August 2008, it inked a deal with [[Rex Sorensen|Sorensen Pacific Broadcasting]] to broadcast its news and entertainment programs to its television and radio broadcasting properties in [[Guam]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. In 2007, [[Myx TV]], a premium television network was launched in the United States. The network caters to the Asian-American youth community in the United States with the primary focus on playing music videos from different artists, genres, and countries. Years later [[Bro (TV channel)|Bro]], a men-focused channel was added to its rosters of international networks.

In 1996, ABS-CBN introduced its second broadcast television network [[Studio 23]] as well as the cable channels [[Myx]] (music), [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] (news), [[Cinema One]] (movie), the [[Lifestyle Network]] (home and lifestyle), [[Kapamilya Channel]] (regionally produced shows.), [[Hero (TV channel)|Hero]] (Tagalog dubbed [[anime]]), [[DZMM TeleRadyo]] (interactive news) and [[Knowledge Channel (Philippines)|Knowledge Channel]] (educational). In the first quarter of 2008 three additional cable channels were added namely [[Balls (TV channel)|Balls]] (sports), [[Velvet (TV channel)|Velvet]] (women-oriented) and the now defunct [[Maxxx]] (men-oriented). The network's radio stations include [[DZMM|DZMM Radyo Patrol 630]] (630&nbsp;kHz AM-Manila), [[DWRR-FM|MOR 101.9 For Life!]] (DWRR 101.9&nbsp;MHz FM-Manila), and also regional FM stations under the brand [[My Only Radio|My Only Radio For Life!]].

ABS-CBN has established regional stations and news bureaus to handle operations in different areas throughout the Philippines and throughout the world. ABS-CBN Global Ltd., the division that is responsible for overseeing all of its international assets has offices and news bureaus on key cities of the world. ABS-CBN International, the largest international subsidiary of ABS-CBN is based in Redwood City, California. In 2008, a state-of-the-art studio facility in Redwood City, California was inaugurated to further expand their programming and technical capabilities. In the same year, San Francisco International Gateway, a teleport company and a subsidiary of ABS-CBN that was incorporated in Richmond, California started to operate. SFIG provides teleport services through its 2.5 acre facilities which consist of 19 satellite dishes and 9 modular equipment buildings.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABS-CBN International|url=http://www.worldteleport.org/members/?id=9023494|publisher=''World Teleport Association''|date=14 December 2011|accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref>

ABS-CBN affirms its social responsibility with its slogan, "In the Service of the Filipino", and through the work of [[ABS-CBN Foundation, Inc.]]. Through media, the foundation has delivered [[E-TV]] (Educational Television) DVDs to hundreds of public schools in the country that benefited students. The foundation is also the umbrella organization of such foundations such as the Knowledge Channel (KCh) Foundation, [[Bantay Bata]] (Children's Watch), Bantay Kalikasan (Environment Watch), and ABS-CBN Bayan Foundation (formerly, ABS-CBN Bayan MicroFinance).

Geny Lopez died of a heart attack and cancer on 29 June 1999 in West Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City. This happened on the same year when the network inaugurated its [[Millennium Transmitter]] in the corporation grounds, resulting in a more clear signal for its television and radio stations nationwide, and put up its own grand New Year's Day broadcast for the year 2000 in 3 simultaneous locations, and unveiled a new logo a day later.

===The ''Kapamilya'' network===
[[File:ABS-CBN logo.svg|thumb|left|150px|ABS-CBN logo (January 1, 2000 - December 31, 2013)]]
In 2003, during the 50th anniversary of Philippine television, ABS-CBN launched its present brand name, "''Kapamilya''" (literally means "a member of the family").

Its international unit ABS-CBN Global Ltd. plans to undertake an initial public offering (IPO) the following year and might list on the Singapore Stock Exchange to help finance its expansion plans.<ref>{{cite web|last=Logata|first=Charo|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=63141|title=ABS-CBN confirms IPO for Global|accessdate=7 April 2007|publisher=''[[ABS-CBN Interactive]]''}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The network celebrated its golden anniversary in 2003. The network held its Kapamilya Homecoming, which gathered over 4,000 former employees and talents for a grand reunion at ABS-CBN’s compound in Bohol Avenue, Quezon City. The network also launched a promo called "Treasure Hunt", where the people were invited to bring their oldest television, radio sets, microphones, and posters. The network also celebrated its 16th year reign in the TV ratings, with 13 of their shows included in the Top 15 daily programs in TV. ABS-CBN also launched new shows such as the then phenomenal ''[[Meteor Garden]]'' etc. The company also did a nationwide caravan, showcasing the network's talents.

In October 2003, the network held a month-long celebration of ABS-CBN and Philippine TV's  50th year.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Vanzi|first=Sol Jose|title=ABS-CBN'S 50TH YEAR CELEBRATES PHILIPPINE TELEVISION|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2003/05/be/be002608.htm|publisher=''Newsflash.org''|date=1 November 2003|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> The station produced two commemorative documentaries about the station's contribution in news and entertainment. ''Sa Mata ng Balita'' encapsulated some of the most unforgettable, most remarkable, and most celebrated landmarks of the last 50 years as captured by television news. ''50 Taong Ligawan: The Pinoy TV History'', on the other hand, was the first extensive television documentary done about the history of Philippine Television and the evolution of Philippine entertainment. For the celebration's finale, the broadcasting giant capped its 50th anniversary with a spectacular extravaganza dubbed as ''Kapamilya: ABS-CBN at 50'',<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.newsflash.org/2003/05/be/be002608.htm| title = ABS-CBN'S 50th Year Celebrates Philippine Television| author = Sol Jose Vanzi| accessdate = April 7, 2007| date = November 1, 2003| publisher = ''[[The Philippine Star]]''}}
</ref> held at the [[Philippine International Convention Center]] (PICC) in Pasay City. It was hailed as one of the biggest media events of the year. The Lopez-led network rolled out the red carpet to welcome its high-profile guests from the business, advertising and media sectors, politics, members of the diplomatic community, with many of the society’s luminaries and glitterati. Valued friends and supporters of the network throughout the five decades also attended the grand affair. The network's official 50 Years station ID won an Award for Excellence in the 2004 Golden Quill Festival.

==Branding of ABS-CBN==
The ABS-CBN logo features three main  elements, the vertical line rooted on a horizontal origin, the three extending circles, and the text ABS-CBN. The vertical line or bar represents a tower (broadcasting tower), with the circles symbolizing its signals representing the red, green and blue or [[RGB]] colors which makes up a [[pixel]] shown on the [[television]]. The 3 divisions of the Philippines, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, are also denoted by the three circles.

===Channel 2===
[[File:BBC2Phils.svg|150px|thumb|left|The logo used by the Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (November 1973-February 25, 1986).]]
Since 1969, the network has started using a channel logo beginning on DZAQ-TV with the early channel 2 logo for use as a promotion from 1969 to 1972 as ''The Family Channel''. The frequency was later awarded to [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] as [[DWWX-TV]] from 1973 to 1986, and had a different logo used.

ABS-CBN introduced an innovation to the channel 2 logo from 1986 to 1992. At first, the channel 2 logo is introduced into ABS-CBN, after the dissolution of BBC in July. The features of the first channel 2 logo is a wing-shaped blue crest with a white curve at the top and a white line as a tail, the Broadway 2 logo was used from 1986 to 1987. It has a slogan name ''Watch Us Do It Again!'' as the station ID aired since the network's revival.

After six months of carefully selected plans, the first tri-ribbon 2 logo laced with a rhomboidal star came to be on 1 March 1987. The tri-ribbon 2 logo's color is white carried the slogan ''The Star Network'' when it aired as a station ID to reclaim the dominance in TV ratings. By 1988, the ribbons in the tri-ribbon 2 logo are tri-colored with red, green and blue. Truly, the tri-ribbon 2 logo was accidentally coming from a shooting star in the form of 2. Similarly, most numerical channel logos within this slogan have a star and versions came into regional TV channels like 3 ([[DYCB-TV]] in Cebu and [[DZRR-TV]] in Baguio), 4 ([[DYXL-TV]] in Bacolod and [[DXAS-TV]] in Davao) and other regional stations.

===Sarimanok===
The [[Sarimanok]], a legendary bird in Philippine Folklore was first used in 1966 to identify color broadcasts (somewhat similar on how the [[NBC logos|NBC peacock]] has been utilized). In 1993, which happens to be the Chinese Year of the Rooster, ABS-CBN relaunched the Sarimanok with a new station ID featuring the legendary bird. The ''Sarimanok'' ID became utmostly associated with the channel that ABS-CBN opted it to become the station's mascot. ABS-CBN later named its new 24-hour news channel the Sarimanok News Network, the precursor of the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]].

===The evolution of ABS-CBN logos===
The ABS-CBN corporate logo started from the Alto Broadcasting System's (ABS) radio tower transmission waves graphic element and original typography that was conceptualized in 1956. James Lindenberg commissioned Delfin L. Borrero, then a fresh fine arts graduate of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman|University of the Philippines in Diliman]], to develop the ABS logo and its logotype. This would later make Borrero the creator of the iconic ABS-CBN logo of today.

In 1966 before ABS and CBN merged, the original logo was modified by Davis Architects which were the architect of the [[Bryant-Denny Stadium]] and [[Leandro Locsin]], architect of the [[Philippine International Convention Center]] (PICC).

In 1967, with the incorporation and final merger of the Quirino-owned Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) and the Lopez-owned Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN), the logo was revised with the same original graphic elements and including the CBN typography. The logo was rendered in black and white for station ID.

The colored rendition of the 1967 logo first appeared on the first color TV broadcast in the country within the year, and later became the company's logo upon its revival.  The tri-band circles are in RGB. Red for Luzon, Green for Visayas and Blue for Mindanao. The colored variation was used subsequently until 2000.

On 1 January 2000, ABS-CBN modified its corporate logo. The previous logo, which heralded ABS-CBN as the largest TV network in the country gave way to the present logo's styling.  The tri-band circles derived from the original radio transmission waves graphic element with colors, red, green, blue with the vertical line at the center still remained and the logotype was enhanced, with the ABS and CBN names merged to create the ABS-CBN name now situated below with a new, modern typography.

Today, the tri-band radio transmission waves graphic element and the original typography are used in derivatives as logos and logotypes of subsidiaries of the ABS-CBN Corporation. [[Arquitectonica]], a Miami-based international architecture, landscape architecture, interior design and urban planning corporation, designed the logo derivatives.
