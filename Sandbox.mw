Its capital is the [[San Fernando, Pampanga|City of San Fernando]].

Pampanga on the northern shore of [[Manila Bay]]. [[Angeles City]], known as province of Pampanga, is classified a city and has a independent government as a province.The Province of Pampanga is the [[Cuisine of the Philippines|culinary]] capital of the Philippines.

The name "La Pampanga" was given by the Spaniards who found the early natives living near the river banks. It also served as the capital of the archipelago for two years from 1762â€“1764 during the British invasion of Manila.  The word ''pampang'', from which the province's name originates, means [[Pampanga River|river]] bank. Its creation in 1571 makes it the first Spanish province in the Philippines. 

[[Clark International Airport]] is located in Pampanga at [[Clark Freeport Zone]], {{convert|16|km}} north of the provincial capital.

The province is home to two [[Philippine Air Force]] [[Airbase|air bases]], [[Basa Air Base]] in [[Floridablanca, Pampanga|Floridabalanca]], and [[Clark Air Base]] in [[Angeles City]].

The province is also honored as one of the 8 rays of the sun in the national flag because of its revolt against the domination of Spaniards.

==History==
Pampanga is the first province discovered by the Spaniards in 1571. It was named after the largest river, [[Pampanga River|Indung Kapampangan River]],  Ancient Pampanga's territorial area used to include portions of the provinces of Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pangasinan, Tarlac and Zambales in the big Island of Luzon of the Philippine Archipelago.

Pampanga, one of the richest provinces in the Philippines, was re-organized as a province by the Spaniards on December 11, 1571. For governmental control and taxation purposes, the Spanish authorities subdivided Pampanga into towns (pueblos), which were further subdivided into districts (barrios) and in some cases into royal and private estates (encomiendas).

Due to excessive abuses committed by some grantees of private estates, the King of Spain prohibited in 1574 the awarding of private estates (encomiendas). However, the royal decree was not fully enforced until the year 1620. In a report of Philippine encomiendas on June 20, 1591, Spanish Governor Gomez Perez Dasmarinas reported to the King of Spain that La Pampanga's encomiendas were Bataan, Betis y Lubao, Macabebe, Candava, Apalit, Calumpit, Malolos, Binto, Guiguinto, Caluya, Bulacan and Mecabayan. The encomiendas of La Pampanga at that time had eighteen thousand six hundred and eighty whole tributes.

Pampanga which is about {{convert|850|sqmi|km2}} in area and presently inhabited by more than 1.5 million people, had its present borders drawn in 1873. During the Spanish regime it was one of the richest Philippine provinces. Manila and its surrounding region were then primarily dependent on Pampangan agricultural, fishery, and forestry products as well as on the supply of skilled workers. As other Luzon provinces were created due to increases in population, some well-established Pampanga towns were lost to new emerging provinces in Central Luzon.

During the 17th century, The [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]] recruited men from Pampanga as mercenaries who served the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]], known as [[Papanggo|Papangers]]<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=DSmqaNFttVkC&pg=PA217&lpg=PA217&dq=papangers+Philippines&source=bl&ots=kG4efKH2_S&sig=oeqRisfL7ieUXsus24kFonP0mR0&hl=es&ei=2yXATbmhMIvAtgeHutHIBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false East of Bali: from Lombok to Timor - Colonial Kupang]</ref> contingent which was a part of the larger [[Mardijker people|Mardijkers]] community. Their legacy can still be found in [[North Jakarta]],<ref>[http://oase.kompas.com/read/2011/04/16/03480617/Opera.Istana.Citerep Citerep Palace Opera] {{id icon}}</ref> however there are no traces of their descendants, except for a small community currently lives in [[Koja, Jakarta#Kampung Tugu|Kampung Tugu]].

[[File:Pampanga, 1899.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pampanga, 1899]]
The historic province of Bataan which was founded in 1754 under the administration of Spanish Governor General Pedro Manuel Arandia, absorbed from the province of Pampanga the municipalities of Abucay, Balanga, Dinalupihan, Llana Hermosa, Orani, Orion, Pilar, and Samal.

The old Pampanga towns of Aliaga, Cabiao, Gapan, San Antonio and San Isidro were ceded to the province of Nueva Ecija in 1848 during the term of Spanish Governor-General Narciso Claveria y Zaldua. The municipality of San Miguel de Mayumo of Pampanga was yielded to the province of Bulacan in the same provincial boundary configuration in 1848.

In 1860, the northern towns of Bamban, Capas, Concepcion, Victoria, Tarlac, Mabalacat, Magalang, Porac and Floridablanca were separated from Pampanga and were placed under the jurisdiction of a military command called Comandancia Militar de Tarlac. However, in 1873, the four latter towns were returned to Pampanga and the other five towns became municipalities of the newly created Province of Tarlac.

On December 8, 1941, Japanese planes bombed Clark Air base marking the beginning of the invasion of Pampanga.

Between 1941 and 1942, occupying Japanese forces began entering Pampanga.

During the Counter-Insurgencies under the Japanese Occupation from 1942 to 1944, Kapampangan guerrilla fighters and the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas fought side by side in the province of Pampanga, attacking and retreating the Japanese Imperial forces for three years and few months of fighting and invasion.

The establishment of the military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was active from 1935 to 1946 and the Philippine Constabulary was active from 1935 to 1942 and 1944 to 1946 in the province of Pampanga. During the military engagements of the Anti-Japanese Imperial Military Operations in Central Luzon from 1942 to 1945 in the province of Bataan, Bulacan, Northern Tayabas (now. Aurora), Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, and Zambales, the local guerrilla resistance fighters and Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas, helped the U.S. military forces fight the Imperial Japanese armed forces.

In the 1945 liberation of Pampanga, Kapampangan guerrilla fighters and the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas supported combat forces from both Filipino and American ground troops in attacking Japanese Imperial forces during the Battle of Pampanga until the end of the Second World War. The sending the local military operations of local Filipino soldiers and officers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 2nd, 21st, 26th, 3rd, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 35th, 36th and 37th Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 3rd Infantry Regiment was recaptured and liberated the province of Pampanga and fought against the Japanese Imperial forces during the Battle of Pampanga.
