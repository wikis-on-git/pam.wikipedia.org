== Landmarks in the City ==
[[Image:Maduraitemple.jpg|thumb|[[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] complex]]
===Meenakshi-Sundareswar Temple===
Madurai's [[Meenakshi Amman Temple|Meenakshi-Sundareswarar]] temple, which stands today as one of India's great cultural and architectural landmarks, was originally built by the early Pandya King Kulasekara. The ancient city of Madurai supposedly was laid out in a lotus-like formation, with the temple at
the center and streets and main thoroughfares layered one after the other concentrically, outward from the center. One legend says that on the day the city was to be named, Lord Shiva blessed the land and its people while divine nectar showered on the city from his matted locks. The city hence came to be known as ''Madhurapuri'' meaning ''The City of Divine Nectar''. The legend is likely a late tale attempting to Sanskritise the otherwise-Dravidian derivative of ''Madurai''.  

===Thirumalai Nayakar Mahal===
[[Image:Thirumalai-Nayak-Palace-Madurai.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Thirumalai Nayak Palace|Thirumalai Naicker Mahal]] at Madurai]]
This palace complex was constructed in the Indo-Saracen style by [[Tirumalai Nayak|Thirumalai Nayakar]] in 1636. It is a national monument and is now under the care of the Tamil Nadu Archaeological Department.

The original palace complex was four times bigger than the present structure. It was divided into two parts, Swarga-vilasa and Rang-vilasa. In each of these there are royal residences, theater, shrines, apartments, armory, palanquin place, royal bandstand, quarters, pond and garden. The ceilings are decorated with large paintings showing Shaivite and Vaishnavite themes.

The portico known as Swarga Vilasam is an arcaded octagon wholly constructed of bricks and mortar without the support of a single rafter or girder. The stucco work on its domes and arches is remarkable. The gigantic pillars and structures represent architectural mastery. The courtyard and the dancing hall are central attractions for visitors. There are 248 pillars, each 58 feet tall and 5 feet in diameter.

Furniture and utensils used by the kings is on exhibit inside the palace. The palace is equipped to perform light and sound shows depicting the story of Silappathikaram, in both Tamil and English languages.

The palace has been featured in many films, such as ''Bombay'', ''Iruvar'', ''Guru'' and ''Jodi''.

===Azhagar Koyil===
[[Image:Sun race.JPG|thumb|Kallazhagar idol]]
[[Azhagar Koyil]], located about 25 km from the city, is a shrine. The location is surrounded by hills. The principal idol of the shrine is that of Lord Kallazhagar. The [[Tamil New Year| Tamil new year]] festival called Chittirai Thiruvizha has been celebrated for centuries in this temple. In the entrance of the Azhagar kovil one can view the [[Badhri Narayanan temple]], built similar to Badrinath near Mount Kailash in northern India:  the principal idol in this shrine represents Vishnu in a meditative posture, flanked by Nara-Narayan. 

The Lord Kallalagar is said to visit the temple on the eve of the Chittirai festival, one of the famous festivals in Tamil Nadu. He starts the journey from the Alagar Koil, crossing the Badri Narayanan Shrine.[1] During this time, he visits Vandiyur, near the Vaigai River, on the eastern outskirts of Madurai. It is believed that he realizes he is too late for his sister's wedding, so refuses to cross the river, and returns disappointed to Alagar Koil.

===Gandhi Museum===
The museum displays information about [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and most importantly it showcases the original blood-stained garment of Gandhi when he was [[assassinated]] by [[Nathuram Godse]]. The other piece of the garment is kept at the Gandhi Museum in Delhi.

===Kazimar Periya Pallivasal===
This famous mosque (masjid) is located at the heart of Madurai city, within 500 metres of the [[Periyar]] bus stand and within 1 kilometre southeast of the Madurai railway junction.

All of his descendants (Huqdars - shareholders of that mosque are called Syeds) have lived in the same locality for 700 years, and have managed the mosque since then. Syed Tajuddin was appointed as Kazi of the sultans, and still his descendants who live at Kazimar street, Madurai, are appointed as Kazis to the [http://www.tn.gov.in Government of Tamil Nadu]. All Syeds belong to the Sunni sect of Islam, its Hanafi school. Most of the descendants of Kazi Syed Tajuddin are shadhilis (shazuli) and follow the Sufi order [http://www.shazuli.com Fassiyatush Shadhiliya].

The traditional legend is that Lord Murugan married [[Deivanai]] at [[Thiruparankundram Murugan Temple]], which also is the first among the Six Holy [[Abode]]s of Murugan (Arupadai Veedu, literally "Six Battle Camps").<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.murugan.org/temples/parankundram.htm |title=Tirupparankundram | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maduraidirectory.com/tourism/thiru.php|title= The first Aru Padai Veedu|accessdate = 2007-05-25}}</ref>
          
A famous Islamic Durgah (shrine) also is located at the top of the hill, where the grave of an Islamic saint Hazrat Sulthan Sikandhar Badushah, who came from Jeddah during the mid 9th century, is found. Irrespective of religion, people from all parts of [[Tamil Nadu]] and from [[Kerala]] visit this durgah -- people who visit [http://www.ervadi.com Ervadi Durgah] in Ramnad district, particularly, are supposed to visit this durgah. Many poems were written in praise of Hazrat Sultan Sikandhar Badhusha, by Syed Abdussalam Ibrahim Saalim Hazrat, the third in the list of [http://www.maqbara.com Madurai Hazrats].
