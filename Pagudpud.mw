'''Pagudpud''' is a coastal resort town on the northernmost tip of Ilocos Norte. It is bounded to the south by the town of Bangui and to the east by the Cordillera Mountain Range, the town of Adams and the province of Cagayan. The [[South China Sea]] lies to the west and north. The town rolls over mountains, hills, valleys and flat coastal land. It lies 45 miles north of [[Laoag City]], the provincial capital, and about 350 miles north of [[Manila]].

Pagudpud is about an hour's drive from [[Laoag City International Airport]].

Saud is by far the town's most popular attraction, with its white-sand beaches and crystal-blue water. [[Coconut]] trees line much of the town's coast. On a good day, you can see the Batanes Islands from [[Patapat National Park]], which includes a starkly beautiful viaduct that rises along the town's sheer coastal mountains.

Pagudpud was decreed a municipality on Feb. 5, 1954. Unlike Laoag, Ilocos Norte's only autonomous city, Pagudpud derives its authority from the provincial government. It had previously been a part of the neighboring town of [[Bangui]].

According to the 2000 census, Pagudpud has a population of 19,315 people. They reside in 3,804 homes that are spread across 83 square miles. Most make their living through farming, fishing and subsistence retailing. Tourism is a growing part of the economy.
