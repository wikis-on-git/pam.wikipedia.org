</div>'''[[Geography|Geography]]''' studies the location, extent, distribution, frequency and interaction of all significant elements of the human and physical environment on the [[Earth]]'s surface, particularly its features and of the distribution of life on the earth, including [[human]] life and the effects of human activity. The word geography derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''&gamma;&eta;'' (''ge'') or ''γαια'' (''gaia'') ("Earth") and ''&gamma;&rho;&alpha;&phi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;'' (''graphein'') ("to inscribe"). [[Physical geography]] focuses on [[Earth science]] (and is sometimes called Earth System Science). This provides an understanding of the physical, [[meteorological]] and [[ecological]] patterns of the Earth. [[Human geography]] includes [[economic geography|economic]], [[political geography|political]] and [[cultural geography|cultural]] geography and focuses on the [[social science]] or the non-physical aspects of the world. It examines how human beings adapt themselves to the land and how they impact the physical world. ''[[Geographer]]s'' not only study the human and natural features of the Earth but also its place in the [[Solar System]] and the [[Universe]] and how this effects the Earth features (e.g. climate, sea currents and tides).
