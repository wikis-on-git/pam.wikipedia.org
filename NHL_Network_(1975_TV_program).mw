'''The NHL Network''' was an American television [[Syndicated television|syndication]] package that broadcast [[National Hockey League]] games from the {{NHL Year|1975}} through {{NHL Year|1978}} seasons.<ref>{{cite news|title=When Will TV Turn its Eye on Two Underdog Sports|date=February 13, 1979|first=Sherry|last=Woods|newspaper=The Miami News|page=6C}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Again Drops Soccer TV Pact|date=November 3, 1976|first=Alex|last=Yannis|newspaper=New York Times|page=76}}</ref> The NHL Network was distributed by the [[Hughes Television Network]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Hughes Network to Show Number of Hockey Games|date=October 11, 1979|newspaper=New York Times|page=B14}}</ref>

==Coverage summary==
Games typically aired on Monday nights<ref name=Chicago>{{cite news|title=TV hockey back, but no Hawks|date=November 9, 1976|first=Gary|last=Deeb|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|page=C2}}</ref> (beginning at 8 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]) or Saturday afternoons. The package was offered to local stations with no rights fee.<ref>{{cite news|title=SHRINKING ACT|date=February 23, 1979|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|first=Gary|last=Deeb|page=E4}}</ref> Profits would be derived from the advertising, which was about evenly split between the network and the local station. The Monday night games were often billed as '''''The NHL Game of the Week'''''.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHL Starts Tonight: Action but No TV|date=October 11, 1978|first=Don|last=Merry|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=E2}}</ref> Viewers in New York City, Buffalo, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Detroit and Los Angeles got the ''Game of the Week'' on a different channel than their local team's games. Therefore, whenever a team had a “home” game, the NHL Network aired the home team's broadcast rather than their own.

Initially, the Monday night package was marketed to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[List of ABC television affiliates (by U.S. state)|affiliates]], the idea being that ABC carried [[Monday Night Football|Monday-night NFL football]] in the fall and (starting in May  {{baseball year|1976}}) [[Monday Night Baseball|Monday-night]] [[Major League Baseball on ABC|Major League Baseball]] in the spring and summer; as such, stations would want hockey to create a year-round Monday night sports block. But very few ABC stations picked up the package.

During the {{NHL Year|1975}} season, the NHL Network showed selected games from the [[Super Series|NHL Super Series]] (the big one in that package was [[1976 Flyers–Red Army game|Red Army at Philadelphia]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Russians And NHL Both Learn|date=January 13, 1976|first=Robin|last=Herman|newspaper=New York Times|page=32}}</ref> but the package didn't include Red Army at [[1975–76 Montreal Canadiens season|Montreal]] on New Year's Eve 1975, which was seen only on [[Hockey Night in Canada|CBC]]) as well as some playoff games. During the {{NHL Year|1976}} season, the NHL Network showed 12 regular season games on Monday nights plus the [[29th National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. By {{NHL Year|1978}} (the final season of the NHL Network's existence), there would be 18 Monday night games and 12 Saturday afternoon games covered.

The [[1979 Challenge Cup (ice hockey)|1979 Challenge Cup]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Challenge Cup is Bait to Lure TV|date=February 9, 1979|first=Dink|last=Carroll|newspaper=Montreal Gazette|page=18}}</ref> replaced the All-Star Game. It was a best of three series between the NHL All-Stars against the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union national squad]].<ref>{{cite news|title=NFL OVERKILL|date=December 15, 1978|first=Gary|last=Deeb|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Television This Week; OF SPECIAL INTEREST|date=February 4, 1979|newspaper=New York Times|page=D35}}</ref> Only the third period of Game 2, which was on a Saturday afternoon, was shown on [[NHL on CBS|CBS]] as part of ''[[The CBS Sports Spectacular]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=The+Soviet+National+Team+flew+home+as+champions+of+the+-+02.19.79+-+SI+Vault&expire=&urlID=431399217&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1094628%2F3%2Findex.htm&partnerID=289881|title=Run Over By The Big Red Machine|date=February 19, 1979|first=E.M.|last=Swift|journal=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Unfortunately, CBS and their sponsors had a problem with the rink board advertising that the NHL sold at [[Madison Square Garden]], and refused to allow them to be shown on TV. As a result, CBS' viewers were unable to see the far boards above the yellow kickplate, and could only see players' skates when the play moved to that side of the ice. Games 1 and 3 were shown on the NHL Network,<ref>{{cite news|title=Plenty for NHL to Ponder About|date=February 13, 1979|first=Frank|last=Brown|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Lewiston Daily Sun|page=26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Sports BRIEFING|date=February 15, 1979|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|page=E3}}</ref> where the advertising was no problem.

===Saturday afternoon coverage===
When Saturday afternoon games were added, the NHL said that they would start at 1 p.m. and end by 4 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]. Apparently, markets with only three stations were reluctant to give up [[prime time]] programming slots. Ultimately, the plan failed, as not only did they not gain new markets, many stations that already carried the Monday game didn't pick up the Saturday one. A few of the markets in the Eastern Time Zone that aired the Saturday afternoon games included [[WSBK-TV|Boston]], [[WKBW-TV|Buffalo]], [[WWOR-TV|New York]], [[WDCA|Washington]] and [[WWLP|Springfield, MA]].

In addition, the NHL gave stations the option of starting the Saturday afternoon broadcasts at 1 Eastern time or starting at 2 EST, with the full open and a first period summary preceding live action of the final two periods. [[WDCA]] (the [[Washington, D.C.]] affiliate) and [[WWLP]] (the [[Springfield, MA]] affiliate) took that option. [[WPGH-TV|WPGH]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and [[WPCH-TV|WTCG]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] didn't pick up the Saturday package, leaving their markets without Saturday coverage. WPGH and WTCG also showed the Monday games on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] at midnight and 11:30&nbsp;p.m. ET, respectively. Meanwhile, by [[1977–78 NHL season|1978]],<ref name=Stations/> [[WUAB-TV|WUAB]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] and [[WBFF]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] dropped hockey coverage completely (Cleveland lost its NHL team, the Cleveland Barons, that [[1977–78 Cleveland Barons season|year after]] just three seasons in that city, which may have led WUAB to drop the package).

Also in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], the Saturday afternoon games during the months of January and February were on [[WGRZ-TV|WGR]]. Meanwhile, the Saturday games during the month of March were on [[WUTV]]. WUTV carried the ''Monday Night Hockey'' package, while WGR was the [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air station]] for the [[Buffalo Sabres]]. In New York, [[WWOR-TV|WOR]] did not carry Saturday games in the months of January or February. Meanwhile, [[WNYW|WNEW]] (also in New York) carried the March Saturday games (at 2 p.m.). In both Buffalo and New York, college basketball and [[World Championship Tennis]] knocked the NHL off its usual Monday night carrier.

In {{NHL Year|1977}}, [[KBJR-TV|KBJR]] in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] picked up the Saturday afternoon package and dropped the Monday night games. In that same season, [[WHMB-TV|WHMB]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] joined the network with Saturday afternoon games at 2 p.m. and Monday night games at 11 p.m. In addition, the Iowa PBS stations had dropped the NHL by this point.

===Playoff coverage===
The [[1976 Stanley Cup Finals]] on the NHL Network marked the first time that the NHL's championship series was nationally televised in its entirety in the United States.<ref name=NewYork>{{cite news|title=NHL Plans Cup TV; Seeks New York Outlet|date=Mar 23, 1976|newspaper=The New York Times|page=46}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Flyer-Maple Leaf Game on TV Tonight|date=April 25, 1976|first=Robin|last=Herman|newspaper=The New York Times|page=165}}</ref> When the NHL Network broadcast playoff games in 1976, [[Marv Albert]] split play-by-play duties with an announcer from one of the participating teams. For instance, on April, 18, 1976 ([[1975–76 Montreal Canadiens season|Montreal]] at [[1976–77 Chicago Black Hawks season|Chicago]]), it was Brad Palmer (who was the intermission host for Chicago Black Hawks telecasts on [[WFLD-TV|WFLD]] 32) who split the play-by-play duties with Albert. Albert did play-by-play for the first and third periods while did Palmer the second. Starting in the [[1978 Stanley Cup playoffs|1978 playoffs]], the NHL Network began [[simulcasting]] many games with ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''.  In these games, [[Dan Kelly (sportscaster)|Dan Kelly]], who was the NHL Network's lead play-by-play announcer, was assigned to do play-by-play along with ''HNIC'' color commentators.  This for example, happened in Game 7 of the quarterfinal series between the [[1977–78 Toronto Maple Leafs season|Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[1977–78 New York Islanders season|New York Islanders]] (April 29), where Kelly teamed up with [[Brian McFarlane]]. The entire [[1978 Stanley Cup Finals]] between the [[1977–78 Montreal Canadiens season|Montreal Canadiens]] and [[1977–78 Boston Bruins season|Boston Bruins]] and the entire [[1979 Stanley Cup Finals]] between the [[1978–79 Montreal Canadiens season|Montreal Canadiens]] and [[1978–79 New York Rangers season|New York Rangers]] were both simulcasted as well.<ref>{{cite news|title=TV Finds New Ways of Rerunning Reruns|date=May 12, 1979|newspaper=The Hendersonville (N.C.) Times-News|page=7}}</ref> However, had that final gone to Game 7, then that game would have been broadcast on [[NHL on ABC|ABC]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=q_QhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1aAFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6148%2C1821764|title=NHL, ABC-TV Agree|first=|date=May 13, 1979|access-date=|page=89|via=Google News Archive|author=Associated Press|newspaper=Reading Eagle}}</ref>

Despite the presence of the [[Minnesota North Stars]], there was no NHL Network affiliate in the [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]-[[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] area.

==Ratings==
By the time that [[NHL on NBC|NBC]]’s contract with the NHL ended after the {{NHL Year|1974}}, they were getting a 3.8 [[Nielsen ratings|rating]]. Meanwhile, the ratings for the NHL Network in its first month of existence were a 3.1 in [[WWOR-TV|New York]], 1.9 in [[KCAL-TV|Los Angeles]], and a 1.3 in [[WSNS-TV|Chicago]]. By {{NHL Year|1978}}, the Monday night games were seen by about 1 million viewers; 300,000 of which were in the [[WSBK-TV|Boston]] area. Also in 1978–79, the 2 p.m. ET version of the Saturday broadcasts (with the first period cut out) was picked up by all participating affiliates except WSBK-TV Boston (which carried the entire game), and often, the cities whose local teams were playing if the local station aired the NHL Network version of a game instead of a locally produced broadcast.

[[Marv Albert]] was the lead play-by-play man during the [[1975–76 NHL season|first season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=NHL-Soviet Games on TV Here|date=December 24, 1975|newspaper=New York Times|page=18}}</ref> During this particular period, he was paired with a local guest announcer. They typically, would split play-by-play duties.

As previously mentioned, for Game 4 of the 1976 quarterfinal playoff series between the [[1975–76 Montreal Canadiens season|Montreal Canadiens]] and [[1975–76 Chicago Black Hawks season|Chicago Black Hawks]] (April 16), Marv Albert and Brad Palmer called the game.
