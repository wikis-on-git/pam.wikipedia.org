Deng tau keraklan atin lang 20 primerang ipan (a ausan da naman

Deng ipan makauri la bilang pamirasu (incisors), pangil (canines), at pangiling (molars).  In the primary set of teeth, there are two types of incisors, centrals and laterals, and two types of molars, first and second.  All primary teeth are replaced with permanent counterparts except for molars, which are replaced by permanent premolars.  Among permanent teeth, 16 are found in the maxilla with the other 16 in the mandible.  The maxillary teeth are the [[maxillary central incisor]], [[maxillary lateral incisor]], [[maxillary canine]], [[maxillary first premolar]], [[maxillary second premolar]], [[maxillary first molar]], [[maxillary second molar]], and [[maxillary third molar]].  The mandibular teeth are the [[mandibular central incisor]], [[mandibular lateral incisor]], [[mandibular canine]], [[mandibular first premolar]], [[mandibular second premolar]], [[mandibular  first molar]], [[mandibular second molar]], and [[mandibular third molar]].  Third molars are commonly called "[[wisdom teeth]]" and may never erupt into the mouth or form at all.  If any additional teeth form, for example, fourth and fifth molars, which are rare, they are referred to as [[Hyperdontia|supernumerary teeth]].<ref>Kokten G, Balcioglu H, Buyukertan M. [http://www.thejcdp.com/issue016/kokten/kokten.pdf Supernumerary Fourth and Fifth Molars: A Report of Two Cases.] Journal of Contemporary Dental Practice, 2003 November; (4)4:067-076.  Page accessed February 10, 2007.</ref>

Most teeth have identifiable features that distinguish them from others.  There are several different [[Dental notation|notation systems]] to refer to a specific tooth.  The three most commons systems are the [[FDI World Dental Federation notation]], the [[Universal numbering system (dental)|universal numbering system]], and [[Palmer Notation Method|Palmer notation method]].  The FDI system is used worldwide, and the universal is used widely in the United States.

=== Enamel ===

{{main|Tooth enamel}}

Enamel is the hardest and most highly mineralized substance of the body and is one of the four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with [[dentin]], [[cementum]], and [[Pulp (tooth)|dental pulp]].<ref>Ross, Michael H., Gordon I. Kaye, and Wojciech Pawlina, "Histology: a Text and Atlas", 4th ed. (Baltimore: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2002), p. 441.</ref> It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. Ninety-six percent of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material composing the rest.<ref>Cate, A. R. Ten, "Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function", 5th ed. (Saint Louis: Mosby-Year Book, 1998), p. 1.</ref> The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white.  At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone.  Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the [[appearance]] of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the [[cusp]], up to 2.5 mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the [[cementoenamel junction]] (CEJ).<ref>Cate, A. R. Ten, "Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function", 5th ed. (Saint Louis: Mosby-Year Book, 1998), p. 219.</ref>

Enamel's primary mineral is [[hydroxyapatite]], which is a [[crystal]]line [[calcium phosphate]].<ref name="biology">Johnson, Clarke. "[http://www.uic.edu/classes/orla/orla312/BHDTwo.html Biology of the Human Dentition]," 1998. Page accessed on January 24, 2007.</ref>  The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts not only for its strength but also for its brittleness.<ref>Cate, A. R. Ten, "Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function", 5th ed. (Saint Louis: Mosby-Year Book, 1998), p. 219.</ref>  Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support.<ref name="biology">Johnson, Clarke. "[http://www.uic.edu/classes/orla/orla312/BHDTwo.html Biology of the Human Dentition]," 1998. Page accessed on January 24, 2007.</ref>  Unlike dentin and [[bone]], enamel does not contain [[collagen]]. Instead, it has two unique classes of [[protein]]s called [[amelogenin]]s and [[enamelin]]s. While the role of these proteins is not fully understood, it is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support among other functions.<ref>Cate, A. R. Ten, "Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function", 5th ed. (Saint Louis: Mosby-Year Book, 1998), p. 198.</ref>

=== Dentin ===

{{main|Dentin}}

Dentin is the substance between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp.<ref name="ross448">Ross, Michael H., Gordon I. Kaye, and Wojciech Pawlina, 2003. ''Histology: a text and atlas.'' 4th edition.  Page 448.  ISBN 0-683-30242-6.</ref> The formation of dentin is known as [[dentinogenesis]]. The porous, yellow-hued material is made up of 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight.<ref name="Cate150">Cate, A.R. Ten.  ''Oral Histology: development, structure, and function.''  5th ed.  1998. Page 150.  ISBN 0-8151-2952-1.</ref> Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.

Dentin is a mineralized [[connective tissue]] with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins.  Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border.<ref name="ross450">Ross, Michael H., Gordon I. Kaye, and Wojciech Pawlina, 2003. ''Histology: a text and atlas.'' 4th edition.  Page 450.  ISBN 0-683-30242-6.</ref> The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 μm near the pulp, to 1.2 μm in the midportion, and 900 nm near the dentino-enamel junction.<ref name="Cate152">Cate, A.R. Ten.  ''Oral Histology: development, structure, and function.''  5th ed.  1998. Page 152.  ISBN 0-8151-2952-1.</ref> Although they may have tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their length is dictated by the radius of the tooth. The three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is genetically determined.

=== Cementum ===

{{main|Cementum}}

Cementum is a specialized bony substance covering the root of a tooth.<ref name="ross448">Ross, Michael H., Gordon I. Kaye, and Wojciech Pawlina, 2003. ''Histology: a text and atlas.'' 4th edition.  Page 448.  ISBN 0-683-30242-6.</ref> It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly [[hydroxyapatite]]), 33% organic material (mainly [[collagen]]) and 22% water.  Cementum is excreted by [[cementoblast]]s within the root of the tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than either dentin or enamel.  The principle role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the [[periodontal ligament]]s can attach to the tooth for stability.  At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the root.<ref name="Cate236">Cate, A.R. Ten.  ''Oral Histology: development, structure, and function.''  5th ed.  1998. Page 236.  ISBN 0-8151-2952-1.</ref> The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the root apex.<ref name="Cate241">Cate, A.R. Ten.  ''Oral Histology: development, structure, and function.''  5th ed.  1998. Page 241.  ISBN 0-8151-2952-1.</ref>

=== Pulp ===
{{main|Pulp (tooth)}}
The dental pulp is the central part of the tooth filled with soft connective tissue.<ref name="Cate150">Cate, A.R. Ten.  ''Oral Histology: development, structure, and function.''  5th ed.  1998. Page 150.  ISBN 0-8151-2952-1.</ref>  This tissue contains blood vessels and nerves that enter the tooth from a hole at the apex of the root.<ref name="Ross451">Ross, Michael H., Gordon I. Kaye, and Wojciech Pawlina, 2003. ''Histology: a text and atlas.'' 4th edition.  Page 451.  ISBN 0-683-30242-6.</ref>  Along the border between the dentin and the pulp are odontoblasts, which initiate the formation of dentin.<ref name="Cate150">Cate, A.R. Ten.  ''Oral Histology: development, structure, and function.''  5th ed.  1998. Page 150.  ISBN 0-8151-2952-1.</ref>  Other cells in the pulp include fibroblasts, preodontoblasts, [[macrophage]]s and [[T cells|T lymphocyte]]s.<ref name="Walton11thru13">Walton, Richard E. and Mahmoud Torabinejad.  ''Principles and Practice of Endodontics.''  3rd ed.  2002. Pages 11-13.  ISBN 0-7216-9160-9.</ref>  The pulp is commonly called "the nerve" of the tooth.
