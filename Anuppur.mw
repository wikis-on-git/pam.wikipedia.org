Now in the present age of globalisation the world has shrunk into a village as the society has advanced in technology. But the tribes, who are the custodians of Indian culture in a real sense, are far behind in this race of advancement. To rescue them from the present plight, the university has put before itself the following aims and objectives: To provide avenues of education, especially higher education and research facilities primarily for the tribal population of India. To disseminate and advance knowledge by providing instructional and research facilities in tribal art, tradition, culture, language, medicinal systems, customs, forest based economic activities, flora, fauna and advancement in technologies relating to the natural resources of the tribal areas. To collaborate with national and international universities and organisations, especially for undertaking cultural studies and research on tribal communities. To formulate tribal centric development models, publish reports and monographs and to organised conferences and seminars on issues relating to tribes and to provide inputs to policy matters in different spheres. To take appropriate measures for promoting the members of tribal communities capable of managing, administering and looking after their own needs by access to higher education through a university of their own. To disseminate and advance knowledge by providing instructional and research facilities in such other branches of learning as it may deem fit. To take appropriate measures for promoting innovations in teaching learning process in inter-disciplinary studies and researches and to pay special attention to the improvement of social, educational and economic conditions and welfare of the scheduled tribes within the Union of India. In view of the aims and objectives the major thrust will be on providing more opportunity for the tribes. However, the university is open to all.
