</div>'''[[Talambye]]''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''bios'', meaning 'life', and ''graphein'', meaning 'to write') is a genre of [[literature]] and other forms of media such as [[film]], based on the written accounts of individual lives.  While a biography may focus on a subject of [[fiction]] or [[non-fiction]], the term is usually in reference to non-fiction.  As opposed to a [[profile]] or [[curriculum vitae]], a biography develops complex insight and highlights different textures of personality including intimate details of experiences.  A biography is more than a list of facts like birth, education, work, relationships and death.  It also delves into the emotions of experiencing such events.
