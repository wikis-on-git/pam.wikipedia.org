[[Image:LocationSouthAmerica.png|thumb|250px|World map showing South America]][[Image:South_America_satellite_orthographic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A satellite composite image of South America]]
'''South America''' is a [[continent]] situated in the [[Western Hemisphere]] between the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s.  Most of it is in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. 

Commonly referred to as part of the [[Americas]], like [[North America]], South America is named after [[Amerigo Vespucci]], who was the first European to suggest that the Americas were not the [[East Indies]], but a previously undiscovered [[New World]]. 

South America has an [[area]] of 17,820,000 [[Square metre#Square kilometre|km&sup2;]] (6,880,000 [[square mile|sq mi]]), or almost 3.5% of the [[Earth]]'s surface. As of [[2005]], its [[population]] was estimated at more than 371,200,000. South America ranks fourth in area (after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, [[Europe]], and North America).

==Geography==
[[Image:AmériqueMéridionale.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Map of South America. (1750) Geograph: Robert de Vaugondy.]]
Geographically, South America is generally considered a continent forming the southern portion of the [[Americas|American]] [[landmass]], south and east of the [[Panama Canal]] transecting the [[Isthmus of Panama]].  Depending on source, South and North America are sometimes considered a single continent or [[supercontinent]], while constituent [[subregion|regions]] are infrequently considered [[subcontinent]]s.  Geopolitically, all of [[Panama]] – including the segment east of the Panama Canal in the isthmus – is often considered a part of North America alone and among the countries of [[Central America]].

It became attached to North America only recently (geologically speaking) with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama some 3 million years ago, which resulted in the [[Great American Interchange]]. The [[Andes]], likewise a comparatively young and seismically restless mountain range, run down the western edge of the continent; the land to the east of the Andes is largely tropical [[rain forest]], the vast [[Amazon River]] basin. The continent also contains drier regions such as [[Patagonia]] and the extremely arid [[Atacama]] desert.

The South American continent also includes various [[island]]s, most of which belong to countries on the continent. The [[Caribbean]] territories are grouped with North America. The South American nations that border the Caribbean Sea &ndash; including [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[French Guiana]] &ndash; are also known as [[Caribbean South America]].

Major natural resources are [[copper]], [[iron]] ore, [[tin]], and [[petroleum|oil]].  The many resources of South America have  become useful around the world. However, they often have hindered the development of diversified economies.  This has lead to major highs and lows in the economy of South American states, often also causing political instability.

South America is home to many interesting species of animals including [[parrots]], [[tarantulas]], [[snakes]], and [[mammals]]. 

The largest country in South America by far, in both area and population, is [[Brazil]], followed by [[Argentina]]. Regions in South America include the [[Andean States]], the [[Guiana]]s, the [[Southern Cone]], and [[Eastern South America]].

==History==
{{main|History of South America}}

==Economy==
[[As of 2002]], South America's unemployment rate was 10.8 %.

Due to histories of high inflation in nearly all South American countries, interest rates and thus investment remain high and low, respectively.  Interest rates are usually double that of the United States. For example, interest rates are about 22 % in Venezuela and 23 % in Suriname. The exception is Chile, which had a head start from 1973 under [[Augusto Pinochet]].

The [[South American Community of Nations]] is a planned continent-wide [[free trade zone]] to unite two existing [[free-trade]] organizations&mdash;[[Mercosur]] and the [[Andean Community]].

In South America, the gap between the rich and the poor is tremendous. In [[Venezuela]], [[Paraguay]], [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]] and many other South American countries, the richest 20 %  may own over 60 % of the nation's wealth, while the poorest 20 % may own less than 5 %. This wide gap can be seen in many large South American cities where makeshift shacks and slums lie next to skyscrapers and upper-class luxury apartments.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of South America}}
[[Roman Catholicism]] is the dominant religion. French Guiana also has a large number of [[Protestantism|Protestants]]. Guyana and Suriname are exceptions, with three major religions: [[Christianity]] in general, [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]].

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are the primary languages of the continent. The majority of South Americans (51%) speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. However, most South American countries are [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking, and nearly all of the continent's [[lusophone|lusophones]] reside in [[Brazil]]. Among other languages used by many South Americans are:
*[[Aymará]] in Bolivia and Peru.
*[[Quechua]] in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru.
*[[Guarani language|Guaraní]] in Paraguay.
*[[English language|English]] in Guyana.
*[[Hindi language|Hindi]] in Guyana and Suriname.
*[[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] in Suriname.
*[[Italian language|Italian]] in certain pockets across southern South America in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, [[German language|German]]  in certain pockets in Brazil, Chile and Paraguay.

South American nations have a rich variety of music. Some of the most famous genres include [[samba]] from [[Brazil]], [[tango music|tango]] from [[Argentina]] and Uruguay and [[cumbia]] from [[Colombia]].

Because of South America's ethnic mix, South American cuisine takes on African, American Indian, and European influences. [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]], is especially well-known for its West African-influenced cuisine.

==People==
Ethnic groups of South America include:
*[[Awá]]
*[[Banawa]]
*[[Caiapos]]
*[[Enxet]]
*[[Europe|European descendants]], especially from [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and [[Italy]].
*[[Ge (people)|Ge]]
*[[Guarani]]
*[[Incas]]
*[[Quechuas]]
*[[Juris]]
*[[Latin peoples]]
*[[Mapuche]]
*[[Mestizo]]
*[[Xucuru]]
*[[Zaparos]]

[[Indigenous peoples (Americas)|Indigenous peoples]] make up the majority of the population in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], and are a significant element in most other former [[Spain|Spanish]] colonies. Exceptions to this include [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. At least three of the Amerindian languages ([[Quechua]] in [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] also in [[Bolivia]], and [[Guarani]] in [[Paraguay]]) are recognized along with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as national languages. 

===Mestizos===
"[[Mestizo]]" is a term of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] origin used to designate the peoples of mixed [[Europe]]an and [[Amerindian]] racial strain inhabiting the region spanning [[Americas|the Americas]]. 

Mestizos officially make up the majority of the populations of [[Chile]] (60%), [[Colombia]] (58%), [[Ecuador]] (65%), [[Paraguay]] (95%) and [[Venezuela]] (67%). Figures in other countries are [[Argentina]] (about 13%), [[Bolivia]] (30%), [[Brazil]] (about 12%), [[Uruguay]] (8%) and [[Peru]] (37%).

===African ancestry===
[[Africa]]ns first arrived with the Spanish and Portuguese in the [[16th century]]. Most were brought as slaves and delivered to [[Brazil]] and the [[Caribbean]]. [[Brazil]] now has about 60 million black people. [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], and [[Guyana]] also have significant black populations.  All the American and Caribbean countries have seen important contributions by Afro-Latin Americans. Historical research on this subject has become more and more prevalent during the last four decades.

''[[Mulato]]'' is a term of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] origin ([[Mulatto]] in English) describing [[Latin Americans]] of mixed African and White racial descent.

''[[Zambo]]'' is a term of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] origin describing [[Latin Americans]] of mixed African and Amerindian racial descent. The feminine form is ''zamba''.

===Usage===
Amongst people in some [[English language|English-speaking]] countries, there is sometimes a tendency to confuse the linguistic and geographic divisions of the Americas: thus, [[Mexico]], some [[Central America]]n and [[Caribbean]] territories are mistakingly included in South America.  The term [[Latin America]] is correctly used when referring to those territories whose official or national languages come from [[Latin]] ([[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).  Conversely, [[Anglo-America]] is used to refer to areas whose major languages are [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] ([[English language|English]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) such as [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Belize]], [[Jamaica]], and much of the [[West Indies]].  Similarly, areas where English is prominent are considered part of the [[Anglosphere]].
