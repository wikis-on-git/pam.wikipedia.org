'''South America''' is a [[continent]] situated in the [[Western Hemisphere]] between the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s.  Most of it is in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. 

Commonly referred to as part of the [[Americas]], like [[North America]], South America is named after [[Amerigo Vespucci]], who was the first European to suggest that the Americas were not the [[East Indies]], but a previously undiscovered [[New World]]. 

South America has an [[area]] of 17,820,000 [[Square metre#Square kilometre|km&sup2;]] (6,880,000 [[square mile|sq mi]]), or almost 3.5% of the [[Earth]]'s surface. As of [[2005]], its [[population]] was estimated at more than 371,200,000. South America ranks fourth in area (after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, [[Europe]], and North America).

==Geography==
[[Image:AmériqueMéridionale.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Map of South America. (1750) Geograph: Robert de Vaugondy.]]
Geographically, South America is generally considered a continent forming the southern portion of the [[Americas|American]] [[landmass]], south and east of the [[Panama Canal]] transecting the [[Isthmus of Panama]].  Depending on source, South and North America are sometimes considered a single continent or [[supercontinent]], while constituent [[subregion|regions]] are infrequently considered [[subcontinent]]s.  Geopolitically, all of [[Panama]] – including the segment east of the Panama Canal in the isthmus – is often considered a part of North America alone and among the countries of [[Central America]].

It became attached to North America only recently (geologically speaking) with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama some 3 million years ago, which resulted in the [[Great American Interchange]]. The [[Andes]], likewise a comparatively young and seismically restless mountain range, run down the western edge of the continent; the land to the east of the Andes is largely tropical [[rain forest]], the vast [[Amazon River]] basin. The continent also contains drier regions such as [[Patagonia]] and the extremely arid [[Atacama]] desert.

The South American continent also includes various [[island]]s, most of which belong to countries on the continent. The [[Caribbean]] territories are grouped with North America. The South American nations that border the Caribbean Sea &ndash; including [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[French Guiana]] &ndash; are also known as [[Caribbean South America]].

Major natural resources are [[copper]], [[iron]] ore, [[tin]], and [[petroleum|oil]].  The many resources of South America have  become useful around the world. However, they often have hindered the development of diversified economies.  This has lead to major highs and lows in the economy of South American states, often also causing political instability.

South America is home to many interesting species of animals including [[parrots]], [[tarantulas]], [[snakes]], and [[mammals]]. 

The largest country in South America by far, in both area and population, is [[Brazil]], followed by [[Argentina]]. Regions in South America include the [[Andean States]], the [[Guiana]]s, the [[Southern Cone]], and [[Eastern South America]].

==History==
{{main|History of South America}}

South America is thought to have been first inhabited by people crossing the [[Bering Land Bridge]], now the [[Bering Strait|Bering]] [[strait]], though there are also suggestions of migration from the southern Pacific Ocean.

===Chavín===
The [[Chavin culture|Chavín]] established a trade network and developed agriculture by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called [[Chavín de Huantar]] in modern [[Peru]] at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavín civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.

===Inca===
Holding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from [[1438]] to [[1533]].  Known as  ''Tahuantinsuyu'', or "the land of the four regions," in [[Quechua]], the Inca culture was highly distinct and developed.  Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork in Inca civilization.

===European colonization===
[[Image:Spainport.GIF|left|thumb|230px|The imaginary lines of the Treaty of Tordesillas.]]
In [[1494]], Portugal and Spain, the two great maritime powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], by which they agreed that all the land outside [[Europe]] should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries. The Treaty established an imaginary line along a north-south [[meridian]] 370 [[leagues]] west of [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly 46° 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (which is now known to comprehend most of the South American soil), would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of [[longitude]] were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]] across the meridian.

Beginning in the [[1530s]], the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first from [[Spain]] and later from [[Portugal]].  These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it into colonies.

European diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]] and [[typhus]]) to which the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native populations]] had no resistance, and cruel systems of forced labor, such as the infamous [[hacienda]]s and mining industry's [[Mita (Inca)|mita]], decimated the American population under Spanish control. After this, African [[Slavery|slave]]s, who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.

The Spaniards were committed to converting their American subjects to Christianity, and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end. However, most initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as American groups simply blended Catholicism with their traditional beliefs. On the other hand, the Spaniards did not impose their language to the degree they did their religion, and the [[Catholic Church]]'s evangelization in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] and [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] actually contributed to the expansion of these American languages, equipping them with writing systems.

Eventually the [[Native Americans (Americas)|Natives]] and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[Mestizo]] class. These and the original Americans were often forced to pay unfair taxes to the Spanish government and were punished harshly for disobeying their laws. Many native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers. This included the many gold and silver sculptures found in the Americas, which were melted down before transport to Europe.

===Independence===
The Spanish colonies won their independence in the first quarter of the [[19th century]], in the [[South American Wars of Independence]]. [[Simon Bolivar]] and [[José de San Martín]] led their independence struggle. In Brazil, a Portuguese colony, [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese [[monarch|king]] [[Dom João VI]], proclaimed the country's independence in [[1822]] and became Brazil's first [[Emperor]]. This was peacefully accepted by the crown in Portugal. Although Bolivar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of the continent politically unified, they rapidly became independent of one another as well, and several further wars were fought, such as the [[War of the Triple Alliance]] and the [[War of the Pacific]].

A few countries did not gain independence until the [[20th century]]:
*[[Trinidad and Tobago]], from the [[United Kingdom]], in 1962
*[[Guyana]], from the [[United Kingdom]], in 1966.
*[[Suriname]], from [[Netherlands|Dutch]] control, in 1975

[[French Guiana]] remains part of [[France]] as of [[2006]], and hosts the [[European Union]]'s principal [[spaceport]], the [[Centre Spatial Guyanais]].

===Recent history===
The continent, like many others, became a battlefield of the [[Cold War]] in the late 20th century. The government of [[Chile]] was overthrown in the early [[1970s]], as a late (and peculiar) development of the [[U.S.]] [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Throughout the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]], [[Peru]] suffered from internal conflicts (see [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] and [[Shining Path]]). Other revolutions and military dictatorships have been common, but starting in the [[1980s]] a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now.  Allegations of corruption remain common, and several nations have seen crises which have forced the resignation of their presidents, although normal civilian succession has continued.

[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] became a notable problem, as most recently illustrated by [[Argentina]]'s default in the early [[21st century]].

==Economy==
[[As of 2002]], South America's unemployment rate was 10.8 %.

Due to histories of high inflation in nearly all South American countries, interest rates and thus investment remain high and low, respectively.  Interest rates are usually double that of the United States. For example, interest rates are about 22 % in Venezuela and 23 % in Suriname. The exception is Chile, which had a head start from 1973 under [[Augusto Pinochet]].

The [[South American Community of Nations]] is a planned continent-wide [[free trade zone]] to unite two existing [[free-trade]] organizations&mdash;[[Mercosur]] and the [[Andean Community]].

In South America, the gap between the rich and the poor is tremendous. In [[Venezuela]], [[Paraguay]], [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]] and many other South American countries, the richest 20 %  may own over 60 % of the nation's wealth, while the poorest 20 % may own less than 5 %. This wide gap can be seen in many large South American cities where makeshift shacks and slums lie next to skyscrapers and upper-class luxury apartments.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of South America}}
[[Roman Catholicism]] is the dominant religion. French Guiana also has a large number of [[Protestantism|Protestants]]. Guyana and Suriname are exceptions, with three major religions: [[Christianity]] in general, [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]].

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are the primary languages of the continent. The majority of South Americans (51%) speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. However, most South American countries are [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking, and nearly all of the continent's [[lusophone|lusophones]] reside in [[Brazil]]. Among other languages used by many South Americans are:
*[[Aymará]] in Bolivia and Peru.
*[[Quechua]] in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru.
*[[Guarani language|Guaraní]] in Paraguay.
*[[English language|English]] in Guyana.
*[[Hindi language|Hindi]] in Guyana and Suriname.
*[[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] in Suriname.
*[[Italian language|Italian]] in certain pockets across southern South America in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, [[German language|German]]  in certain pockets in Brazil, Chile and Paraguay.

South American nations have a rich variety of music. Some of the most famous genres include [[samba]] from [[Brazil]], [[tango music|tango]] from [[Argentina]] and Uruguay and [[cumbia]] from [[Colombia]].

Because of South America's ethnic mix, South American cuisine takes on African, American Indian, and European influences. [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]], is especially well-known for its West African-influenced cuisine.

==People==
Ethnic groups of South America include:
*[[Awá]]
*[[Banawa]]
*[[Caiapos]]
*[[Enxet]]
*[[Europe|European descendants]], especially from [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and [[Italy]].
*[[Ge (people)|Ge]]
*[[Guarani]]
*[[Incas]]
*[[Quechuas]]
*[[Juris]]
*[[Latin peoples]]
*[[Mapuche]]
*[[Mestizo]]
*[[Xucuru]]
*[[Zaparos]]

[[Indigenous peoples (Americas)|Indigenous peoples]] make up the majority of the population in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], and are a significant element in most other former [[Spain|Spanish]] colonies. Exceptions to this include [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. At least three of the Amerindian languages ([[Quechua]] in [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] also in [[Bolivia]], and [[Guarani]] in [[Paraguay]]) are recognized along with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as national languages. 

===Mestizos===
"[[Mestizo]]" is a term of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] origin used to designate the peoples of mixed [[Europe]]an and [[Amerindian]] racial strain inhabiting the region spanning [[Americas|the Americas]]. 

Mestizos officially make up the majority of the populations of [[Chile]] (60%), [[Colombia]] (58%), [[Ecuador]] (65%), [[Paraguay]] (95%) and [[Venezuela]] (67%). Figures in other countries are [[Argentina]] (about 13%), [[Bolivia]] (30%), [[Brazil]] (about 12%), [[Uruguay]] (8%) and [[Peru]] (37%).

===African ancestry===
[[Africa]]ns first arrived with the Spanish and Portuguese in the [[16th century]]. Most were brought as slaves and delivered to [[Brazil]] and the [[Caribbean]]. [[Brazil]] now has about 60 million black people. [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], and [[Guyana]] also have significant black populations.  All the American and Caribbean countries have seen important contributions by Afro-Latin Americans. Historical research on this subject has become more and more prevalent during the last four decades.

''[[Mulato]]'' is a term of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] origin ([[Mulatto]] in English) describing [[Latin Americans]] of mixed African and White racial descent.

''[[Zambo]]'' is a term of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] origin describing [[Latin Americans]] of mixed African and Amerindian racial descent. The feminine form is ''zamba''.

===Usage===
Amongst people in some [[English language|English-speaking]] countries, there is sometimes a tendency to confuse the linguistic and geographic divisions of the Americas: thus, [[Mexico]], some [[Central America]]n and [[Caribbean]] territories are mistakingly included in South America.  The term [[Latin America]] is correctly used when referring to those territories whose official or national languages come from [[Latin]] ([[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).  Conversely, [[Anglo-America]] is used to refer to areas whose major languages are [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] ([[English language|English]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) such as [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Belize]], [[Jamaica]], and much of the [[West Indies]].  Similarly, areas where English is prominent are considered part of the [[Anglosphere]].
