'''Helen Adam''' (b. [[December 2]], [[1909]] in [[Glasgow, Scotland]] â€” d. [[September 19]], [[1993]] in [[New York City]]) was an [[American poet]], [[collagist]] and [[photographer]] who was an active participant in The [[San Francisco Renaissance]], a literary movement contemporaneous to the [[Beat Generation]] that occurred in San Francisco during the 1950s and 1960s. Though often associated with the Beat poets, she would more accurately be considered one of the predecessors of the Beat Generation.
She was 82 when she died.

:'''Margaretta's Rime'''

:''In Amsterdam, that old city,''
:''Church bells tremble and cry;''
:''All day long their airy chiming''
:''Clavers across the sky.''
<br />
:''I am young in the old city,''
:''My heart dead in my breast.''
:''I hear the bells in the sky crying,''
:''"Every being is blest."''
<br />
:''In Amsterdam, that old city,''
:''Alone at a window I stand,''
:''A spangled garter my only clothing,''
:''A candle flame in my hand.''
<br />
:''The people who pass that lighted window,''
:''Looking me up and down,''
:''Know I am one more tourist trifle''
:''For sale in this famous town.''
<br />
:''Noon til dusk at the window waiting,''
:''Nights of fury and shame.''
:''I am young in an old city''
:''Playing an older game.''
<br />
:''I hear the bells in the sky crying''
:''To the dead heart in my breast,''
:''The gentle bells in the sky crying''
:''Every being is blest."''
