'''Luzón''' refers to the largest and most politically important [[island]] in the [[Philippines]] and to one of the three island groups in the country, with [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]] being the other two. Luzon as an island group includes the island of Luzon itself, plus the [[Batanes]] and [[Babuyan Islands|Babuyan]] groups of islands to the north, and the main and outlying islands of [[Catanduanes]], [[Marinduque]], [[Masbate]], [[Romblon]], and [[Mindoro]] in the south. The island group of [[Palawan]], which used to be a province belonging to an administrative region of Luzon has been transferred to Region VI in the Visayas in 2005.

==Geography==

Luzon's area is [[1 E11 m²|104,688 square kilometers]], making it the [[List of islands by size|world's 17th largest island]]. It is the fourth [[List_of_islands_by_population|most populous island in the world]]. Located on Luzon are the country's capital, [[Manila]], and its most populous city, [[Quezon City]]. The island is very [[mountain]]ous and is home to [[Mt. Pulag]], the second highest mountain in the country and [[Mayon Volcano|Mayon]], the most famous [[volcano]]. To the west of Luzon island is the [[South China Sea]] (Luzon Sea in Philippine territorial waters), to the east is the [[Philippine Sea]], and to the north is [[Luzon Strait]] containing [[Babuyan Channel]] and [[Balintang Channel]].

The main part of the island is roughly rectangular in shape and has the long [[Bicol Peninsula]] protruding to the southeast. The northern part of the island contains the largest [[mountain range]] in the country, the [[Cordillera Central, Luzon|Cordillera Central]]. [[Mount Pulag]], the second highest mountain in the country, is located there, rising 2,922 m. To the east of the Cordillera Central is the large [[Cagayan Valley]], which serves as the basin for the [[Cagayan River]], the longest river in the Philippines. To the east of the valley rises the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountain range, easily the longest range in the country.

The Sierra Madre snakes southwards into the central and southern part of the island. Between it and the [[Zambales Mountains]] to the west is the largest plain, the Central Luzon plain. This plain, approximately 11,000&nbsp;km&sup2; in size, is the country's largest producer of rice. Among the rivers irrigating this plain, the longest are [[Agno]] to the north, and [[Pampanga River|Pampanga]] to the south. In the middle of the plain rises the solitary [[Mount Arayat]]. To the west, in the Zambales Mountains, rises [[Mount Pinatubo]], made famous because of its enormous [[1991]] eruption.

The Zambales mountains extends to the sea in the north, forming [[Lingayen Gulf]], home to the [[Hundred Islands National Park]]. To the south, the mountains also extend into the sea, forming the [[Bataan Peninsula]], which encloses the [[Manila Bay]]. This natural [[harbor]] is considered to be one of the best natural ports in East Asia, due to its size and strategic geographical location.

To the southeast of Manila Bay is the largest lake in the country, and also the largest inland lake in Southeast Asia, the [[Laguna de Bay]] (Old Spanish, Lake of Bay town). This 949&nbsp;km&sup2; lake is drained by the [[Pasig River]] into Manila Bay. Pasig River is one of the most important rivers in the country due to its historical significance and because it runs through the center of [[Metro Manila]].

Located just 20&nbsp;km southwest of Laguna de Bay is [[Taal Lake]], within the southwestern portion of the island. This caldera of a lake contains the smallest [[volcano]] of the country, [[Taal Volcano]], which rises on the island in the center of the lake. The volcano in turn has a lake in its crater. All the surrounding areas of Taal Lake were once part of a massive prehistoric volcano that covered the southern portion of the province of Cavite, Tagaytay City, and the whole of Batangas province.

Off the southwestern portion of Luzon is the island of Mindoro, separated by the [[Verde Island Passages]]. The passages connect the South China Sea to the east with the [[Tayabas Bay]]. To the south of the bay is the island of Marinduque.

The southeastern portion of Luzon is dominated by the [[Bicol Peninsula]]. This is a mountainous and narrow region that extends approximately 150&nbsp;km southeast.  Along it are numerous gulfs and bays. In the north is [[Lamon Bay]], which contains [[Alabat Island]] and is south of the [[Polillo Islands]] of [[Quezon|Quezon province]]. Other bays and gulfs include [[San Miguel Bay]], [[Lagonoy Gulf]], [[Ragay Gulf]], and [[Sorsogon Bay]].

To the east of the peninsula lies the island of Catanduanes. Leading to it is the [[Caramoan Peninsula]]. Off the southeast tip of Bicol is [[Samar (island)|Samar island]], separated by [[San Bernardino Strait]]. Bicol Peninsula is connected to the main part of Luzon through the [[Tayabas Isthmus]]. Extending south from the isthmus is the [[Bondoc Peninsula]].

The Bicol Peninsula is also home to numerous volcanoes. The most famous is [[Mayon Volcano]] in [[Albay]]. This 2,460 m high volcano is symmetrically shaped, rivaling that of [[Mount Fuji]] in [[Japan]], and is a symbol of the [[Bicol Region]]. Other notable mountains are [[Mount Isarog]] and [[Mount Iriga]] in [[Camarines Sur]], and [[Mount Bulusan]] in [[Sorsogon]].

Located off the southwestern coast of the Bicol Peninsula are the islands of [[Ticao Island|Ticao]], [[Burias Island|Burias]], and Masbate.

==Island Group of Luzon==

The island group of Luzon is an arbitrary grouping of islands divided into eight [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]], which are further subdivided into 37 [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]], of which only seven are not on Luzon island itself. The island group includes the Batanes and Babuyan islands to the north, and the islands of Catanduanes, Masbate, Marinduque, Romblon, and Mindoro in the south.

==Regions of Luzon==

The eight regions are listed below, discussed individually.
Its administrative centers are for formality's sake only, meaning, there is no 'valid' regional administrative center (except in the case of Administrative regions), the power being vested by the provincial governments. The regional centers are only the head tourist offices for the region.

* [[Ilocos Region]] (Region I)
* [[Cagayan Valley]] (Region II)
* [[Central Luzon]] (Region III)
* [[CALABARZON]] (Region IV-A)
* [[MIMAROPA]] (Region IV-B)
* [[Bicol Region]] (Region V)
* [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] (CAR)
* [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] (NCR)

'''Ilocos Region (Region I)''' is located in the northwest portion of the main island. Its provinces are: [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Ilocos Sur]], [[La Union province|La Union]], and [[Pangasinan]]. Its inhabitants are mostly of [[Ilokano_language|Ilocano]] descent and the main languages are [[Ilokano_language|Ilokano]] and [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]]. The region's administrative center is [[San Fernando City, La Union]]. The city of [[Vigan]] in Ilocos province is the oldest surviving Spanish colonial city in the Philippines. 

'''Cagayan Valley (Region II)''' is located in the northeast portion of the main island and also covers the Batanes and Babuyan islands to the north. The valley is surrounded by the [[Cordillera Central, Luzon|Cordillera Central]] and [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountain ranges. Running through its center is the country's longest river, Cagayan River. Its provinces are Batanes, [[Cagayan]], [[Isabela]], [[Nueva Vizcaya]], and [[Quirino]]. The region's administrative center is [[Tuguegarao City]] in Cagayan province.

'''Central Luzon (Region III)''' contains the largest [[plain]] of the country and produces most of the country's [[rice]] supply. Its provinces are
[[Aurora province|Aurora]], [[Bataan]], [[Bulacan]], [[Nueva Ecija]],  [[Pampanga]], [[Tarlac]], and [[Zambales]]. The region's administrative center is [[San Fernando City, Pampanga]].  The former [[United States Navy]] base of [[Subic Bay]], now a [[free port]], is located in Zambales province.

'''CALABARZON (Region IV-A)''', one of the newest regions of the country, was previously a part of [[Southern Tagalog]] (Region IV). It is one of the most populated areas of the country. The name of the region is actually an acronym that stands for its provinces, which are [[Batangas]], [[Cavite]], [[Laguna province|Laguna]], [[Quezon]], and [[Rizal]]. The Tagalogs are the dominant ethnic group in this region, with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] as the main language. Its' recognized administrative center is [[Manila]], which is in [[Metro Manila]], however, some government officials still consider [[Quezon City]], which is also in [[Metro Manila]] as the administrative center, and also, [[Lucena City]], in [[Quezon province]].

'''MIMAROPA (Region IV-B)''', along with CALABARZON is the newest region of the country, and was previously a part of Southern Tagalog (Region IV). It contains most of the islands in the Luzon group. The name of the region is actually an acronym that stands for its provinces, which are [[Marinduque]], [[Occidental Mindoro]], [[Oriental Mindoro]], [[Romblon]], and formerly [[Palawan]], which is now in the [[Western Visayas]] region.

'''Bicol Region (Region V)''' occupies the [[Bicol Peninsula]] at the southeastern end of Luzon island, plus the outlying islands which include the island provinces of Catanduanes and Masbate. The remaining mainland provinces are [[Albay]], [[Camarines Norte]], [[Camarines Sur]], and [[Sorsogon]]. The region's administrative center is [[Legazpi City]] in Albay. The inhabitants are of Bicolano descent with [[Bikol language | Bikol]] as the main language.

'''Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR)''' almost completely covers the [[Cordillera Central, Luzon|Cordillera Central]] mountain range of Northern Luzon. CAR, created in [[1989]] is a special administrative region for the indigenous tribes of these mountains. Its provinces are [[Abra province|Abra]], [[Apayao Province|Apayao]], [[Benguet]], [[Ifugao]], [[Kalinga Province|Kalinga]], and [[Mountain Province]]. The regional center is [[Baguio City]].

'''National Capital Region (NCR)''' is a special administrative region that contains the capital of the country, Manila; the country's most populous city, Quezon City; and an additional 15 more cities and municipalities. The region is more popularly known as [[Metro Manila]]. It is the only region in the country that has no provinces, and is the most densely populated with over 10 million people living in a 636 km&sup2; area.
