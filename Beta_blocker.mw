Beta blockers may also be referred to as '''beta-adrenergic blocking agents''', '''beta-adrenergic antagonists''', or '''beta antagonists'''.

== Pharmacology ==
Beta blockers block the action of [[endogenous]] [[catecholamine]]s ([[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) and [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) in particular), on β-[[adrenergic receptor]]s, part of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] which mediates the "[[fight or flight]]" response. 

There are three known types of beta receptor, designated β<sub>1</sub>, β<sub>2</sub> and β<sub>3</sub>. β<sub>1</sub>-Adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the heart and in the kidneys. β<sub>2</sub>-Adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, uterus, vascular smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle. β<sub>3</sub>-receptors are located in fat cells.

Examples of beta-blockers include: Sectral, Zebeta, Brevibloc, Inderal, Tenormine, Normodyne, Coreg, and Lopressor

===β-Receptor antagonism===
Stimulation of β<sub>1</sub> receptors by epinephrine induces a positive [[chronotropic]] and [[inotropic]] effect on the heart and increases cardiac conduction velocity and automaticity. Stimulation of β<sub>1</sub> receptors on the kidney causes renin release. Stimulation of β<sub>2</sub> receptors induces [[smooth muscle]] relaxation (resulting in [[vasodilation]] and [[bronchodilation]] amongst other actions), induces tremor in [[skeletal muscle]], and increases [[glycogenolysis]] in the [[liver]] and [[skeletal muscle]]. Stimulation of β<sub>3</sub> receptors induces [[lipolysis]].

Beta blockers inhibit these normal epinephrine-mediated [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] actions, but have minimal effect on resting subjects. That is, they reduce the effect of excitement/physical exertion on heart rate and force of contraction, dilation of blood vessels and opening of bronchi, and also reduce tremor and breakdown of [[glycogen]].

It is therefore expected that non-selective beta blockers have an [[antihypertensive]] effect. The antihypertensive mechanism appears to involve: reduction in cardiac output (due to negative chronotropic and inotropic effects), reduction in [[renin]] release from the kidneys, and a [[central nervous system]] effect to reduce [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] activity (for those β-blockers that do cross the blood-brain barrier, e.g. Propranolol).

Antianginal effects result from negative [[chronotropic]] and [[inotropic]] effects, which decrease cardiac workload and oxygen demand.

The antiarrhythmic effects of beta blockers arise from sympathetic nervous system blockade – resulting in depression of [[sinus node]] function and [[atrioventricular node]] conduction, and prolonged [[atrium (anatomy)|atrial]] [[refractory period (cardiac)|refractory period]]s. [[Sotalol]], in particular, has additional antiarrhythmic properties and prolongs [[action potential]] duration through [[potassium channel]] blockade.

Blockade of the sympathetic nervous system on renin release leads to reduced aldosterone via the [[Renin-angiotensin_system|renin angiotensin aldosterone system]] with a resultant decrease in blood pressure due to decreased sodium and water retention.

===Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity===
Some beta blockers (e.g. [[oxprenolol]] and [[pindolol]]) exhibit intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA).  These agents are capable of exerting low level [[receptor agonist|agonist]] activity at the β-adrenergic receptor while simultaneously acting as a receptor site [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]. These agents, therefore, may be useful in individuals exhibiting excessive [[bradycardia]] with sustained beta blocker therapy.

Agents with ISA are not used in post-[[myocardial infarction]] as they have not been demonstrated to be beneficial. They may also be less effective than other beta blockers in the management of [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and [[tachyarrhythmia]].<ref name="Rossi">{{cite book | editor=Editor Rossi S | title=[[Australian Medicines Handbook]] |year=2006 |location=Adelaide |publisher=Australian Medicines Handbook}}</ref>

===α<sub>1</sub>-Receptor antagonism===
Some beta blockers (e.g. [[labetalol]] and [[carvedilol]]) exhibit mixed antagonism of both β- and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors, which provides additional [[arteriole|arteriolar]] vasodilating action.

===Other effects===
Beta blockers decrease nocturnal [[melatonin]] release, perhaps partly accounting for sleep disturbance caused by some agents.<ref name="pmid10335905">{{cite journal |author=Stoschitzky K, Sakotnik A, Lercher P, ''et al'' |title=Influence of beta-blockers on melatonin release |journal=Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=111–5 |year=1999 |pmid=10335905 |doi=}}</ref>
Beta blockers protect against social anxiety: "Improvement of physical symptoms has been demonstrated with beta-blockers such as propranolol; however, these effects are limited to the social anxiety experienced in performance situations." <ref name="anxiety">{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/416878_print |title=Social Anxiety Disorder: A Treatable Condition|accessdate=2007-10-06||first=Jonathan|last=Davidson, M.D.|coauthors=Connor M.D., Kathryn M.|publisher=Cliggott Publishing, Division of SCP Communications|work=Drug Benefit Trends 11(5)|pages=5BH-7BH|date=1999}}</ref>
Beta blockers can impair the relaxation of bronchial muscle (mediated by beta-2) and so should be avoided by asthmatics.

== Clinical use ==
Large differences exist in the pharmacology of agents within the class, thus not all beta blockers are used for all indications listed below.

Indications for beta blockers include:
* [[Hypertension]]
* [[Angina pectoris|Angina]]
* [[Mitral valve prolapse]]
* [[Cardiac arrhythmia]]
* [[Congestive heart failure]]
* [[Myocardial infarction]]
* [[Glaucoma]]
* [[Migraine]] [[prophylaxis]]
* Symptomatic control ([[tachycardia]], [[tremor]]) in [[anxiety]] and [[hyperthyroidism]]
* [[Essential tremor]]
* [[Phaeochromocytoma]], in conjunction with [[alpha blocker|α-blocker]]

Beta blockers have also been used in the following conditions:
* Hypertrophic obstructive [[cardiomyopathy]]
* Acute dissecting [[aortic aneurysm]]
* [[Marfan syndrome]] (chronic treatment with propranolol slows progression of aortic dilation and its complications)
* Prevention of variceal bleeding in [[portal hypertension]]
* Possible mitigation of [[hyperhidrosis]]
*[[Social anxiety disorder]] and other [[anxiety disorders]]

===Congestive heart failure===
Although beta blockers were once contraindicated in [[congestive heart failure]], as they have the potential to worsen the condition, studies in the late 1990s showed their positive effects on morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure.<ref name="pmid10714728">{{cite journal |author=Hjalmarson A, Goldstein S, Fagerberg B, ''et al'' |title=Effects of controlled-release metoprolol on total mortality, hospitalizations, and well-being in patients with heart failure: the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in congestive heart failure (MERIT-HF).

[[Bisoprolol]], [[carvedilol]] and sustained-release [[metoprolol]] are specifically indicated as adjuncts to standard [[ACE inhibitor]] and [[diuretic]] therapy in congestive heart failure.

The beta blockers are a benefit due to the reduction of the heart rate which will lower the myocardial energy expenditure. This is turns prolongs the diastolic filling and lengthens coronary perfusion.<ref name="pmid12173717">{{cite journal |author=Pritchett AM, Redfield MM |title=Beta-blockers: new standard therapy for heart failure |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=77 |issue=8 |pages=839–45; quiz 845–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12173717 |doi= |url=http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf%2F7708%2F7708crc%2Epdf |format=PDF}}</ref> Beta blockers have also been a benefit to improving the ejection fraction of the heart despite an initial reduction in it.

Trials have shown that Beta blockers reduce the absolute risk of death by 4.5% over a 13 month period. As well as reducing the risk of mortality, the number of hospital visits and hospitalizations were also reduced in the trials.<ref name="pmid12173717">{{cite journal |author=Pritchett AM, Redfield MM |title=Beta-blockers: new standard therapy for heart failure |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=77 |issue=8 |pages=839–45; quiz 845–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12173717 |doi= |url=http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf%2F7708%2F7708crc%2Epdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

===Anxiety and performance enhancement===
Some people, particularly [[musicians]], use beta blockers to avoid [[stage fright]] and tremor during public performance and [[Audition (performing arts)|audition]]s.  The physiological symptoms of the fight/flight response associated with [[Stage fright|performance anxiety]] and [[panic]] (pounding heart, cold/clammy hands, increased respiration, sweating, etc.) are significantly reduced, thus enabling anxious individuals to concentrate on the task at hand.  Officially, beta blockers are not approved for [[anxiolytic]] use by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]].  <ref name="pmid16957148">{{cite journal |author=Schneier FR |title=Clinical practice. Social anxiety disorder |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=355 |issue=10 |pages=1029–36 |year=2006 |pmid=16957148 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp060145}}</ref>

Since they lower heart rate and reduce tremor, beta blockers have been used by some [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[marksman|marksmen]] to enhance performance, though beta blockers are banned by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).<ref name="ref4">{{cite web | author= World Anti-Doping Agency | title=The World Anti-Doping Code: The 2006 Prohibited List International Standard | url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1037.pdf | date=19/09/2005 | publisher=[[World Anti-Doping Agency]] | accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> Although they have no recognisable benefit to most sports, it is acknowledged that they are beneficial to sports such as archery and shooting.

== Adverse effects ==
[[Adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) associated with the use of beta blockers include: [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], [[bronchospasm]], [[dyspnea]], cold extremities, exacerbation of [[Raynaud's syndrome]], [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]], [[heart failure]], [[heart block]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[dizziness]], abnormal vision, decreased concentration, [[hallucinations]], [[insomnia]], nightmares, [[clinical depression]], [[sexual dysfunction]], [[erectile dysfunction]] and/or alteration of [[glucose]] and [[lipid]] [[metabolism]]. Mixed α<sub>1</sub>/β-antagonist therapy is also commonly associated with [[orthostatic hypotension]]. [[Carvedilol]] therapy is commonly associated with [[edema]].<ref name="Rossi"/>

[[Central nervous system]] (CNS) adverse effects (hallucinations, insomnia, nightmares, depression) are more common in agents with greater lipid solubility, which are able to cross the [[blood-brain barrier]] into the CNS. Similarly, CNS adverse effects are less common in agents with greater aqueous solubility (listed below).

Adverse effects associated with β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor antagonist activity (bronchospasm, peripheral vasoconstriction, alteration of glucose and lipid metabolism) are less common with β<sub>1</sub>-selective (often termed "cardioselective") agents, however receptor selectivity diminishes at higher doses. Beta blockade, especially of the beta-1 receptor at the macula densa inhibits renin release, thus decreasing the release of aldosterone. This causes hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.

A 2007 study revealed that diuretics and beta-blockers used for hypertension increase a patient's risk of developing [[diabetes]] whilst [[ACE inhibitors]] and [[Angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers) actually decrease the risk of diabetes.<ref name="pmid17240286">{{cite journal |author=Elliott WJ, Meyer PM |title=Incident diabetes in clinical trials of antihypertensive drugs: a network meta-analysis |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |pages=201–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17240286 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60108-1}}</ref>  Clinical guidelines in Great Britain, but not in the United States, call for avoiding diuretics and beta-blockers as first-line treatment of hypertension due to the risk of diabetes.<ref name="pmid16809680">{{cite journal |author=Mayor S |title=NICE removes beta blockers as first line treatment for hypertension |journal=BMJ |volume=333 |issue=7557 |pages=8 |year=2006 |pmid=16809680 |doi=10.1136/bmj.333.7557.8-a |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7557/8-a}}</ref>

Beta blockers must not be used in the treatment of [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]], or other alpha adrenergic [[stimulant]] [[overdose]].  The blockade of only beta receptors increases [[hypertension]], reduces coronary blood flow, left [[ventricular function]], and [[cardiac output]] and tissue perfusion by means of leaving the alpha adrenergic system stimulation unopposed. <ref name=Toxicity,Cocaine;eMedicine>[http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic400.htm eMedicine - Toxicity, Cocaine : Article by Carlos J Roldan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The appropriate [[antihypertensive]] drugs to administer during hypertensive crisis resulting from stimulant abuse are [[vasodilators]] like [[nitroglycerin]], [[diuretics]] like [[furosemide]] and [[alpha blockers]] like [[phentolamine]]. <ref name=Toxicity,Amphetamine;eMedicine>[http://www.emedicine.com/EMERG/topic23.htm eMedicine - Toxicity, Amphetamine : Article by Neal Handly<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
