==Betawiki: better support for your language in MediaWiki==
Dear community. I am writing to you to promote a special wiki called [[betawiki:|Betawiki]]. This wiki facilitates the localisation (l10n) of the MediaWiki interface. You may have changed many messages here to use your language in the interface, but if you would log in to for example the Japanese language Wiktionary, you would not be able to use the interface as well translated as here. In fact, of 1,736 messages in the core of MediaWiki, 12.32% of the messages have been translated. Betawiki also supports the translation of messages for 126 extensions, with 2,174 messages. Many of them are used in WMF projects and they are vital for understanding the wiki. Currently 6.53% of the WMF extension messages have been translated. Translators for over 90 languages contribute their work to MediaWiki this way every month.

If you wish to contribute to better support of your language in MediaWiki, as well as for many MediaWiki extensions, please visit [[betawiki:Translating:Intro|Betawiki]], [http://translatewiki.net/w/?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup&uselang=en create an account] and [[betawiki:Betawiki:Rights|request translator privileges]]. You can see the current status of localisation of your language on [[mw:Localisation_statistics|MediaWiki.org]] and do not forget to get in touch with others that may already be [[betawiki:Translating:Languages|working on your language on Betawiki]].

If you have any further questions, [[betawiki:User_talk:GerardM|please let me know on my talk page on Betawiki]]. We will try and assist you as much as possible, for example by [[betawiki:Import requests|importing]] all messages from a local wiki for you to start with, if you so desire.

You can also find us on the Freenode [[w:en:Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] network in the channel #mediawiki-i18n where we will be happy to help you get started.

Thank you very much for your attention and I do hope to see some of you on [[betawiki:|Betawiki]] soon! Thanks, [[betawiki:User:GerardM|GerardM@Betawiki]]

==Bot policy==
Hello. To facilitate [[m:steward|steward]] granting of bot access, I suggest implementing the [[m:Bot policy|standard bot policy]] on this wiki. In particular, this policy allows stewards to automatically flag known interlanguage linking bots (if this page says that is acceptable), which form the vast majority of such requests. The policy also enables [[m:Bot policy#Global_bots|global bots]] on this wiki (if this page says that is acceptable), which are trusted bots that will be given bot access on every wiki that allows global bots.

This policy makes bot access requesting much easier for local users, operators, and stewards. To implement it we only need to create a redirect to this page from [[Project:Bot policy]], and add a line at the top noting that it is used here. Please read the text at [[m:Bot policy]] before commenting. If you object, please say so; I hope to implement in one week if there is no objection, since it is particularly written to streamline bot requests on wikis with little or no community interested in bot access requests. [[User:Carsrac|Carsrac]] 08:33, 25 Abril 2009 (UTC)
: Please make the comments on the [[Project:Bot policy]] page. I will move any botrequest from this page to the correct page. [[User:Carsrac|Carsrac]] 08:45, 25 Abril 2009 (UTC)
