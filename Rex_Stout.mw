''Current Biography'' (1946), New York: H. W. Wilson Co., 1947, p. 576. Essays by both Will Cuppy ("How to Read a Whodunit") and Rex Stout ("Watson Was a Woman") appeared in ''The Art of the Mystery Story: A Collection of Critical Essays'', edited by Howard Haycroft (Simon and Schuster, 1946). Cuppy likened Wolfe to Falstaff 1936, in his review of ''The Rubber Band''. In 1959, Stout's beloved character Hattie Annis stated the comparison to Wolfe himself, immediately after being introduced to him in the novella "Counterfeit for Murder."</ref> Sinulat no ning talasaup nang Wolfe, i [[Archie Goodwin (fictional detective)|Archie Goodwin]], deng kasu ning henyong detektib manibat 1934 (''[[Fer-de-Lance (novel)|Fer-de-Lance]]'') anggang 1975 (''[[A Family Affair (novel)|A Family Affair]]'').
