'''Thomas Davenport''' (9 July 1802 &ndash; 6 July 1851) was a [[Vermont]] [[blacksmith]] who invented the first American [[Direct current|DC]] electrical motor in 1834.<ref>[http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/davenport.html Thomas Davenport 
]</ref>

He lived in Forest Dale, a village near the town of [[Brandon, Vermont|Brandon]].

As early as 1834, he developed a battery-powered electric motor. He used it to operate a small-model car on a short section of track, paving the way for the later electrification of [[streetcars]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=dAElGDvk2yUC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=%22thomas+davenport%22+streetcar&source=web&ots=h96mutrV5s&sig=q6RnbGmS9lT3is89lLHLmB_-ARw&hl=en&ei=KX2WSYuTL4Oh-gbm7byBCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result Electrifying America by David E. Nye, p.86, from Google Books]. Retrieved 14 February 2009.</ref>

With his wife [[Emily Davenport|Emily]], and a colleague Orange Smalley, Davenport received the first American [[patent]] on an electric machine in 1837, U. S. Patent No. 132.
