'''GMA Network, Incorporated''' ({{Pse2|GMA7|GMAP}}), a Philippine multi-media conglomerate, is a [[television network]] in the [[Philippines]]. GMA provides news and entertainment programs through its forty-seven fully-owned television relay stations, four affiliate television stations and thirty-four radio stations throughout the Philippines. The network also offers its shows worldwide through [[GMA Pinoy TV]], [[GMA Life TV]] and Internet TV [http://www.mygma.com.ph myGMA.com.ph].

Its headquarters, the GMA Network Center, is located at EDSA corner Timog Ave., Diliman, [[Quezon City]], Philippines. [[Felipe Gozon|Atty. Felipe Gozon]] is its current Chairman and CEO. In Metro Manila, it uses terrestrial [[VHF]] Channel 7 ([[DZBB-TV]]), Channel 11 ([[DZOE-TV]], leased from [[ZOE Broadcasting Network]], operated by [[Q (television network)|Q]]) and terrestrial UHF Channel 27 ([[DZRV-TV]]).
== History ==
=== Origins ===

The origin of GMA can be traced to [[DZBB]] of ''Loreto F. de Hemedes, Inc.''<ref name=Origins>[http://www.gmanetwork.com/about GMA Network Corporate Information], GMANetwork.com</ref> owned by Robert Stewart, an American war correspondent (The company's name was christened after Stewart's wife). The station first went on-air on June 14, 1950 at the fourth floor of the Calvo Building in Escolta, [[City of Manila|Manila]]. It went on to cover events such as [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ramon Magsaysay]]'s sudden death, the eruption of Mt. Hibok-Hibok on March 17, 1957 and the various elections in the country. DZBB became the first radio station in the country to use the telephone patch for live interviews.<ref name="ABC">''GMA Gold: Fifty Years of Broadcast History'', Chelo Banal Formoso (ed.), GMA Network.</ref> The station also broadcast the forerunner of today's political satire programs with ''Kwentong Kutsero'' and glued audiences to the amateur radio contest, ''Tawag ng Tanghalan''.<ref name="ABC" /> A decade after the radio station's launch, the Stewarts ventured into television. Using two cameras and a surplus transmitter, [[DZBB-TV|Channel 7]], the Philippines' third television station, started airing on October 29, 1961. While the station's programming were mostly canned shows from the United States, the station did produce local programming like ''Uncle Bob's Lucky Seven Club'', ''Dance Time with Chito'', ''[[Lovingly Yours, Helen]]'' and various news programs. During the establishment of the television station, it was always in the red and was always at a distance from the larger and better funded networks. But it did not stop the company to start broadcasting in [[Cebu province|Cebu]] ([[DYSS-TV]]) in 1963. The company was renamed to ''Republic Broadcasting System'' in 1970.<ref name="Origins"/>

=== GMA Radio-Television Arts ===
[[File:GMA logo 1980.PNG|150px|left|thumb|GMA Radio-Television Arts logo used from 1979 to 1992.]]
On September 21, 1972, then [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] placed the entire Philippines under [[Martial Law]]. Military troops entered radio and television stations and placed them under military control to prevent "communist" propaganda. All media outlets that were critical of the Marcos regime were shut down.

Foreign citizens and corporations were disallowed from owning media outlets in the country. Stewart and the [[American Broadcasting Corporation]], who owned a quarter of the company,<ref name="ABC" /> was forced to cede majority control to a [[triumvirate]] composed of Gilberto Duavit, a [[Malacañang]] official, Menardo Jimenez, and [[Felipe Gozon]] in 1974.<ref name="PinoyTV">''What's the story, Pinoy TV?'', Ellen Joy Anastacio and Janine Natalie Badiola, GMA Network.</ref> Through the acquisition, the station now was able to broadcast in [[color television|color]] with a seven million [[Philippine peso|peso]] credit line.  The station also changed its name to ''GMA Radio-Television Arts'' (GMA stood for Greater Manila Area, the station's initial coverage area), although RBS remained its corporate name until 1996. Jimenez sits as president of the company while Gozon served as its chairman.

When [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, Jr.]], a senator who strongly opposed the Marcos administration, was assassinated on August 21, 1983, it was a small item on television news. The iron grip that the Marcos administration had on television began to slip, as GMA broadcast the funeral, the only local station to do so.<ref name="ABC" /> In 1984, [[Imee Marcos]], daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, attempted to take over GMA.<ref name="ABC" /><ref name="PinoyTV" />  However, the takeover was prevented by GMA executives. Stewart left the Philippines for good as he was utterly disappointed with the Marcos move. GMA was also instrumental during the years preceding the [[1986 EDSA Revolution|People Power Revolution]]. The network was the first to air a television interview with [[Corazon Aquino]] in 1984, and when she later announced that she would run for the presidency if she receives one million signatures.<ref name="ABC" />  In February 1986, the network was also the first to report that [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] broke away from the Marcos administration.<ref name="ABC" />

When democracy in the Philippines was restored in the People Power Revolution in 1986, television stations began to air, some with their original owners. The political instability of the country also added to the station's burden, when soldiers stormed into the studios for two days in a part of coup attempt to topple then President, Corazon Aquino. In 1987, it opened its high-end live studio, the Broadway Centrum, boosting its local programming, and inaugurated its 777-foot ''Tower of Power'' located along Tandang Sora Avenue, [[Quezon City]], the tallest man-made structure in the country in 1988.

=== The ''Rainbow'' network ===
[[File:GMA RAINBOW.jpg|thumb|right|GMA Network in Rainbow Satellite since April 30,1992]]
International reach became GMA's target in the 1990s, which began when the ''Rainbow Satellite'' launched on April 30, 1992. Through its relay stations, GMA programs were seen across the archipelago and Southeast Asia. GMA programming started airing in 60 American cities and parts of South America through the ''International Channel Network''. GMA was also the official broadcaster of the 1995 [[World Youth Day]], which was the last visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to the country. During the same year, two popular TV shows, ''[[Eat Bulaga]]'' (from [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]]) and ''[[Okey Ka Fairy Ko!]]'' (from [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]]) began broadcasting on GMA after airing for sometime in [[ABS-CBN]]. At the same time, GMA launched a UHF channel, [[DWDB-TV|Citynet 27]], several new shows (among them were [[Bubble Gang]] and [[Startalk]], now some of the longest-running shows on TV), and the news program, ''[[Saksi]]'' with [[Mike Enriquez]], [[Mel Tiangco]] and [[Jay Sonza]].

In 1996, GMA formally changed its corporate name to ''GMA Network Incorporated'', with GMA now standing for ''Global Media Arts''. [[GMA Films]] was also launched in the same year - its film ''[[José Rizal (film)|José Rizal]]'', which was at the time the most expensive movie production ever in the country (costing over 80 million Pesos to produce), but becoming a huge success with many accolades and award nominations. GMA was the first Philippine broadcaster to receive a [[Peabody Award]] for Investigative Reporting in 1999. Later, Citynet 27 became EMC, the first locally programmed music video channel, later becoming a part of the [[Channel V|Channel [V]]] franchise. Channel [V] Philippines, however, ceased operations due to a conflict of interest between the owners of GMA and [[PLDT]] (which bought a stake in GMA), who operate [[MTV Philippines]] through their subsidiary, the [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation]]. GMA was also the Philippine broadcaster for [[2000 Today]]. At the beginning of the year, Menardo Jimenez announced his retirement as president and CEO and on December 31, 2000, Felipe Gozon assumed the position with his concurrent capacity as chairman. Gilberto Duavit Jr. assumed the post of Chief Operating Officer.

=== The ''Kapuso'' network ===
[[File:Kapuso unveiling.jpg|thumb|left|GMA Network unveil their new corporate logo at the [[GMA Network Center]].]]
On October 27, 2002, during an episode of the network's Sunday afternoon entertainment show ''[[SOP Rules|SOP]]'', GMA officially revealed a new logo and image campaign. The new logo features a rainbow colored heart, the ''Kapuso'', represented by a new slogan "''[[Kapuso ng Pamilyang Pilipino, Anumang Kulay ng Buhay]]''" ("''One in Heart With the Filipino family, In Whatever Colors of Life''").

In [[2003]], ''Saksi'' won the New York Festival Gold Medal for best newscast, the first Philippine newscast to do so. This, and the Peabody Award in [[1999]], earned the network a [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] commendation later that year. On September 1 of the same year, GMA Network withdrawn its membership from the ''Kapisanan ng mga Brodkasters ng'' Pilipinas (KBP),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/sep/30/ent_3-1.htm |title=KBP to GMA 7: Don't let rulings taint your view |date=September 29, 2003 | publisher=inq7.net |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050210034619/http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/sep/30/ent_3-1.htm |archivedate=2005-02-10}}</ref> after incidents involving host [[Rosanna Roces]], alleged commercial overloading and interfering when news anchor [[Mike Enriquez]] aired his complaints over his radio program, ''[[Saksi sa Dobol B]]'', against Lopez-owned cable firm [[SkyCable]]'s distortion of GMA's signal on its system, and a lost videotape containing evidence that the cable firm had violated the rule on soliciting ads for cable TV.  GMA was also an official TV network of the 4th World Meeting of Families held in Manila, Philippines.

[[File:GMA Network logo.jpeg|thumb|right|Kapuso logo]]

The company’s subsidiary, Citynet Inc., also signed a co-production and blocktime agreement with [[ZOE Broadcasting Network]], allowing the GMA Network with another platform to showcase its programming and talents. In November 11, 2005, ZOE's flagship station, [[DZOE-TV|DZOE-TV Channel 11]], went on the air as ''[[Quality TeleVision]]'' (now known as ''Q''), and broadcasts shows that primarily targets women audiences. Q's news programs share the same resources of [[GMA News and Public Affairs]], while some programs are produced by Citynet, Inc. Also in 2005, GMA won the [[Asian Television Awards]]' Best Terrestrial Television Station, besting MBC of Korea and Mediacorp Channel 5 of Singapore. The network planned to go public, but due to political instability and downward trend of broadcast advertising, it has since been delayed. <ref name ="IPO1">''"GMA Network cancels IPO until "issues" are resolved"''. Television Asia, April 2005. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5026/is_200504/ai_n18239428]</ref>

In 2006, ''[[Debate with Mare at Pare]]'', a late-night public affairs program, won the bronze medal in the New York Festival. The network was also praised on its coverage of the ''Wowowee'' (a program of [[ABS-CBN]]) stampede by various local publications. In an exclusive interview, a reprehensive [[Mike Enriquez]] also interviewed embattled Philippine president, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] for the first time since the lifting the State of National Emergency, which the network allowed other stations to air without prior consent. At the end of the interview, the President praised the network for its news coverage, hinting that other media outfits to do the same. In April, the founder of the network, Robert "Uncle Bob" Stewart died in the United States. During the Everest climbing season the same year, GMA supported climber [[Romi Garduce]], the third Filipino to reach the summit of [[Mt. Everest]] in only three days. The network is one of the first local companies to produce an iMax film, with the opening of the San Miguel-Coca-Cola [[iMax]] Theater in [[SM Prime Holdings|SM's]] [[SM Mall of Asia|Mall of Asia]].

== Branding of the GMA Network ==
=== Evolution of GMA Network logos ===
GMA Network has used a number of logos throughout its history especially when the station was acquired by Gozon, Jimenez and Duavit in the 1970s. In the 1980s, the network first used it slogan, ''"Where You Belong"'', which it would use for two decades. For the first time in 1989, the network identified itself as the "Rainbow Network," after the colors of the rainbow. Throughout the 1990s, the network refined the logo before having it replaced by the its current logo in 2002. After a huge marketing campaign, and improved ratings, the new logo is now one of the most recognizable in the country.

=== GMA Network Center ===
{{main|GMA Network Center}}
[[File:GMA-Network-Center.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The GMA Network Center from the ground up]]
GMA inaugurated its new GMA Network Center facility on June 14, 2000 as part of the kick-off of the year-round celebration of its 50th anniversary. The GMA Network Center supports GMA's thrusts towards digitalization and media convergence.  While the first phase of the project has already been completed with the construction of the 17-story high-rise, the center has an option to upgrade the older, existing facilities in the GMA compound, as originally planned. The network center is equipped with MARC (Multiple Automated Recorder Cassette) and a [[Broadcast automation|Broadcast Automation System]] that allows the network to manage live feeds and international feeds that will be carried out to GMA Pinoy TV subscribers around the world. The GMA compound has five studios, three of which are in the new network center, and two in the older structures. The Center serves as the Corporate Headquarters for the network and also houses the radio station and the newsroom.

=== GMA Network Studios ===
[[GMA Network]] had to built an 3000 meter newly state-of-the-art studio building beside the old studio.In which it can audience more than 1000 people. GMA Network inaugurated its new state-of-the-art GMA Network Studios on October 17, 2008 with a red carpet event. It has new studios (studio 4 & 5) for the live shows like SOP. The production lights and accessories made from other countries and costs [[Philippine peso|Php]]1 billion. GMA Network Center/Studios is also located at the GMA Network Drive.

=== GMA Broadway Centrum ===
Located in New Manila, Quezon City, the Westside Theater cinema of the Broadway Centrum was converted into a high-end live studio in 1987 to serve as an alternative studio for the network's programs. It was inaugurated to usher in GMA's broadcast in Stereovision. In the 1990s, the Broadway Centrum served as the live studio (with 700 audience capacity) of GMA's variety shows, "[[Lunch Date]]", "[[That's Entertainment (TV series)|That's Entertainment]]", "Vilma!" and "[[GMA Supershow]]". In 1995, the network built a second studio inside Broadway Centrum by renovating the Eastside Theater cinema (renaming it TAPE Studios and can accommodate 400 studio audiences), which is the current home of [[Eat Bulaga!]]. Once one of the most modern broadcast facility in the country, it was later renovated in 2000 when the musical variety show [[SOP (Sobrang Okey Pare)|SOP]] moved to Studio 3 of the [[GMA Network Center]]. In 2003, it accommodated live studio audiences as it served as the live venue of the eliminations of the reality-based talent search ''[[StarStruck (Philippine TV series)|StarStruck]]''.

=== Competition ===

Changes were apparent in the programming of the network in 2004. The production of various shows were up to par with its rival network, ABS-CBN. ''[[Extra Challenge]]'' started to lead the game. And with launch of the ''[[telefantasya]]'' ''[[Mulawin]]'', GMA finally gained a rating advantage in Mega Manila over ABS-CBN, officially on September 23, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/07/21/ENTR2006072169735.html |title=After withdrawing from KBP, GMA 7 became No. 1! |publisher=Manila Bulletin Online |date=2006-07-21 |accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref>  By the end of the year, GMA was one of the most profitable companies in the country.

In 2005, GMA began broadcast of ''[[Darna (TV series)|Mars Ravelo's Darna]]'', a classic comic book character among Filipinos which became a big hit, with its ratings being the highest ever for a pilot episode of 47.7% and the first telefantasya to hit up to 52.1%, followed by ''[[Encantadia]]'' at 47.2 percent at [[Mega Manila]]. Other primetime telefantasyas like ''[[Mulawin]]'' (2004) and ''[[Sugo]]'' (2005) also maintained the network's lead in its Mega Manila ratings during the year.

In 2006, GMA maintained its primetime ratings re-formatting shows ''[[Extra Challenge]]'' and ''Encantadia'' (which was succeeded by sequels ''[[Etheria]]'' and ''[[Encantadia: Pag-ibig Hanggang Wakas]]''), and by the localized versions of the Korean series, ''[[Stairway to Heaven]]'', ''[[Full House]]'', ''[[Jewel in the Palace]]'' and ''My Name is Kim Sam Soon.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/top/14938/Top-Asianovelas-since-the-year-2002 |title=Top Asianovelas since the year 2002 |publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal |author=Salanga, Elyas Isabelo  |date=2008-01-16 |accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref>

In 2007, GMA started broadcast of [[Mari Mar (TV series)|MariMar]], an original Mexican telenovela turned into Filipino version that became a huge hit, in which the final episode got 52.6%, making it the  only soap opera to achieve the highest rating in the network's history.

In a 2006 survey conducted by [[Pulse Asia]], 7 out of 10 Metro Manila-based viewers find GMA Network a more credible network than rival ABS-CBN.<ref>[http://www.journal.com.ph/index.php?page=news&id=11709&sid=6&urldate=2006-09-10 Journal Online - Philippine Tabloid featuring news, current events, celebrities, entertainment, local balita, tsismis, and much more<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The network managed to lead in the Mega Manila and Southern Luzon demographic, which has the highest television ownership and up to 79% of advertisement spots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/oct/27/yehey/business/20061027bus7.html |title=ABS-CBN leads GMA 7 in viewership share |date=October 27, 2006 |publisher=The Manila Times |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071024115516/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/oct/27/yehey/business/20061027bus7.html |archivedate=2007-10-24}}</ref>  The NUTAM was officially launched last October 16, 2006 to determine the TV ratings and audience share of local TV Programs from the different urban areas in the Philippines. This changes the television landscape and the manner in which the advertisers will allocate their TV investments to achieve cost efficiency and maximize each. With this larger geographical measurement coverage, a greater level of accountability and confidence in television as a primary advertising medium is achieved.

As of August  2007, GMA maintained its lead in Mega Manila TV ratings against rival ABS-CBN for the first half of 2007 citing Mega Manila TV ratings data from AGB-Nielsen GMA (as shown below), which resulted to a 23 percent growth in its consolidated net income to P1.13 billion in the first half of the year from P915 million in the same period last year. <ref>[http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/08/15/BSNS20070815100336.html GMA Network posts P1.13-B net income in 1st half, up 23%], ''Manila Bulletin'', n.d.
