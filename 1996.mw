'''DWAT-TV''' ({{lang-ko|아리랑 TV}}) is an international, English-language network based in [[Seoul]], [[Timog Korea]], operated by [[:en:Korea International Broadcasting Foundation|The Korea International Broadcasting Foundation]]. The channel presents a diverse lineup of programs ranging from cultural features, documentaries, language programs and other entertaining segments designed to give viewers a contemporary and accurate look at Korea, Asia and the world at large. The network’s name, “[[Arirang]],” is derived from the traditional Korean folk song of the same name.

==Arirang TV==

Founded in 1996, Arirang TV airs news, cultural programs, educational shows, documentaries and more 24 hours a day, in more than 188 countries. As Korea's premier English-language channel, Arirang's mission is to present an accurate view of Korea to the world through unbiased news reports and programs featuring a diversity of perspectives. Viewers with little knowledge about Korea or with an outdated impression of the country can gauge the pulse of the fast-changing nation through Arirang.

Some of the network's most popular and longest-running shows include ''Arirang News, Showbiz Extra, Pops in Seoul and Heart to Heart''. "Arirang News" is one of many current affairs shows that provide up-to-the-minute, objective and in-depth coverage of domestic and international news. Through such programs as "Diplomacy Lounge" and the talk show "[[Heart to Heart]]," viewers can gain diverse insights and perspectives on Korea, glimpsing the country through the eyes of foreign diplomats, visiting international newsmakers and more. Though government affiliated, Arirang retains independent programming rights and presents a timely and accurate portrait of Korea.

Arirang also airs programs about Asia and the world, offering viewers in Korea and abroad culturally diverse content. Whether it's through a culinary show about global cuisines or a commercial made in conjunction with UNICEF to combat world hunger, Arirang serves as an international channel that bridges cultures.

Operated by The Korea International Broadcasting Foundation, Arirang broadcasts three channels: Arirang World, Arirang Korea and Arirang Arab. The network offers subtitles in languages including Arabic, Chinese and Spanish. Starting on March 3, 2008 Arirang TV adding three more languages namely Russian, Vietnamese and Indonesian. It is free-to-air in much of Europe, North America, Asia (excluding Korea), Australia and the Pacific region, and provided via [[Astra 1E]], Hotbird 3, Intelsat (PAS) 2, 8, 9 and 10 and Arabic feed in Asiasat 3s and Badr4. Arirang Korea feed is now available in Koreasat 3 via [[SkyLife]] DTH service.

Arirang TV is viewed by many observers as very 'biased and unrealistic' in its coverage of South Korea, many of their programs allegedly showing characteristics of [[propaganda]], similar to China's [[:en:CCTV-9|CCTV News]]. It has also been known to censor negative views of South Korea <ref>[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2872719 Arirang TV] (Arirang gets rid of annoying outside views)</ref><ref>[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2873221 Arirang TV] (Response)</ref>.

==New look==
On July 17, 2006, Channel NewsAsia revamped the look of both feeds to a more contemporary feel. New hard studios were designed, replacing the virtual studios used in the past. The new look also introduced a simpler, more unified overall theme during news programs.

On July 5, 2010, the channel revealed a redesigned, two-tier ticker. The top displays ways to access Channel NewsAsia online including social networks and breaking news when it happens.  The right side of the top bar also has information on stock market indices and currency exchange rates (on weekdays) and time information (on weekends), while the bottom continues to show content from the previous ticker. Graphics from various programs like [[Money Mind]] were also revamped, as well as the anchor lineups of certain programmes.

==Mga natatanging katangian==
When an interviewee gives his/her views in a language other than English, Channel NewsAsia does not superimpose the original audio with a voice translation unlike other news organisations.  Instead, an English subtitle appears preserving and complementing the original audio.  This includes programmes that use Mandarin, Japanese or Korean as their main language.  

Moreover, most news networks provide programmes for 24 hours a day but Channel NewsAsia closes down for around 3 hours (for Singapore viewers) or 3 1/2 hours (for international viewers) and will give text headlines until 6.00 HK/SIN time.

==Programa at Presents==
Channel NewsAsia is a news channel focusing primarily on Asian news and current affairs. Each of its news bulletins run for half-hour, starting at the top of the hour, except for ''Primetime Morning'', which runs for three consecutive hours. The bottom of the hour features [[documentaries]], lifestyle programming, [[health]] programming, current affairs and [[business]] news. The channel airs programmes 20 hours a day - with an extra 30 minutes for international viewers - seven days a week. Text of the latest news headlines are featured for the remaining four hours of the day except during major breaking news as was the case months following the September 11, 2001 attacks and the early days of the [[Iraq war]].

Channel NewsAsia now telecasts its flagship local news bulletin, ''Singapore Tonight'' to all its viewers, both locally in Singapore and internationally live. Parent company MediaCorp said the changes were made in response to requests from viewers in countries like [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Vietnam]], who have been asking for more in-depth content on Singapore. Previously, ''Singapore Tonight'' was made available internationally only on a replay basis at 2.00am (SIN/HK) and selected segments of that programme were shown on ''Asian Home News''.  During its run, ''Singapore Business Tonight'' was not regularly shown to international viewers prior to July 2008.  

Channel NewsAsia also produces news stories for the newscast on Singapore's only English-language general-entertainment channel, [[:en:MediaCorp Channel 5|MC5]].

==Mga feed at ticker==
Channel NewsAsia has two separate feeds, namely a Singapore feed - Channel NewsAsia Singapore - and a regional feed - Channel NewsAsia International. Both feeds have the almost the same programmes, especially since ''Singapore Tonight'' and ''Singapore Business Tonight'' started airing live internationally on July 7, 2008.  The exception to this is ''20/20'', which only airs in Singapore.  The Singapore feed airs a total of 20 hours of programmes while the international feed airs 30 minutes longer to include a replay of Singapore news.  As the station is about to sign-on and closedown, the national anthem is played in Singapore.  

Other important differences include a short, one-minute ''Singapore Update'' at various times of the day in the Singapore feed, the content of advertising where those in the Singaporean feed cater to local audiences, and the order in which magazine programmes/documentaries are aired within the week.  In addition, the Singaporean feed is supplemented by a [[Teletext]] service. Furthermore, during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], viewers in Singapore are given more highlights of the games than regional viewers.   

Channel NewsAsia's Singapore feed is available as a free-to-air television network in Singapore, hence cable or IPTV subscription isn't required to receive the channel.  Channel NewsAsia International is available on the [[AsiaSat 3S]] and [[Hot Bird]] satellites as well as various cable/satellite operators.  

The news and stock [[ticker]] tape is a permanent feature on Channel NewsAsia and, since August 2001, has not been taken off the air during commercials. This allows for uninterrupted viewing of the latest news and stock prices. Singapore viewers are given local news and live prices from the [[Singapore Exchange]] as well; regional viewers are given delayed stock prices from various regional exchanges. In addition, Singapore viewers do get a timepiece on ''Primetime Morning''.

===Relo at Sponsors sa relo sa harap ng mga balita===

''Ang karagdagang impormasyon: [[:en:Clock time|Clock time]]''

For Singapore viewers, Channel NewsAsia has a watch to countdown to the top of the hour, as a lead-in to live news bulletins.  The announcer usually says it this way: "Time by (sponsor): (time)."  Sponsors include Patek Philippe, ACCA ,Tag Heuer, Frank Muller,Jetstar, CapitaLand, and F.P. Journe.

==Mga Website==
Channel NewsAsia also has a website: [http://channelnewsasia.com channelnewsasia.com].  The website features news and video reports from Singapore, Asia Pacific, the rest of the world as well as business, sports, technology, entertainment and special reports.  Various presenters and correspondents maintain blogs on this site.  The site also has a 7-day archive of news.  A live stream of Channel NewsAsia International is available on the channel's website in areas covered by AsiaSat 3S (including Singapore).  YOURNEWS is a feature on this site where viewers can upload first-hand footage of news events happening in their area, and visitors can also view such footage.

The channel used to maintain a website in mandarin: cnachinese.com, which was discontinued in year 2010.
