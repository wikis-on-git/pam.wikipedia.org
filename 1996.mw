'''DWAT-TV''' ({{lang-ko|아리랑 TV}}) is an international, English-language network based in [[Seoul]], [[Timog Korea]], operated by [[:en:Korea International Broadcasting Foundation|The Korea International Broadcasting Foundation]]. The channel presents a diverse lineup of programs ranging from cultural features, documentaries, language programs and other entertaining segments designed to give viewers a contemporary and accurate look at Korea, Asia and the world at large. The network’s name, “[[Arirang]],” is derived from the traditional Korean folk song of the same name.

==Arirang TV==

Founded in 1996, Arirang TV airs news, cultural programs, educational shows, documentaries and more 24 hours a day, in more than 188 countries. As Korea's premier English-language channel, Arirang's mission is to present an accurate view of Korea to the world through unbiased news reports and programs featuring a diversity of perspectives. Viewers with little knowledge about Korea or with an outdated impression of the country can gauge the pulse of the fast-changing nation through Arirang.

Some of the network's most popular and longest-running shows include ''Arirang News, Showbiz Extra, Pops in Seoul and Heart to Heart''. "Arirang News" is one of many current affairs shows that provide up-to-the-minute, objective and in-depth coverage of domestic and international news. Through such programs as "Diplomacy Lounge" and the talk show "[[Heart to Heart]]," viewers can gain diverse insights and perspectives on Korea, glimpsing the country through the eyes of foreign diplomats, visiting international newsmakers and more. Though government affiliated, Arirang retains independent programming rights and presents a timely and accurate portrait of Korea.

Arirang also airs programs about Asia and the world, offering viewers in Korea and abroad culturally diverse content. Whether it's through a culinary show about global cuisines or a commercial made in conjunction with UNICEF to combat world hunger, Arirang serves as an international channel that bridges cultures.

Operated by The Korea International Broadcasting Foundation, Arirang broadcasts three channels: Arirang World, Arirang Korea and Arirang Arab. The network offers subtitles in languages including Arabic, Chinese and Spanish. Starting on March 3, 2008 Arirang TV adding three more languages namely Russian, Vietnamese and Indonesian. It is free-to-air in much of Europe, North America, Asia (excluding Korea), Australia and the Pacific region, and provided via [[Astra 1E]], Hotbird 3, Intelsat (PAS) 2, 8, 9 and 10 and Arabic feed in Asiasat 3s and Badr4. Arirang Korea feed is now available in Koreasat 3 via [[SkyLife]] DTH service.

Arirang TV is viewed by many observers as very 'biased and unrealistic' in its coverage of South Korea, many of their programs allegedly showing characteristics of [[propaganda]], similar to China's [[:en:CCTV-9|CCTV News]]. It has also been known to censor negative views of South Korea <ref>[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2872719 Arirang TV] (Arirang gets rid of annoying outside views)</ref><ref>[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2873221 Arirang TV] (Response)</ref>.

==New look==
On July 17, 2006, Channel NewsAsia revamped the look of both feeds to a more contemporary feel. New hard studios were designed, replacing the virtual studios used in the past. The new look also introduced a simpler, more unified overall theme during news programs.

On July 5, 2010, the channel revealed a redesigned, two-tier ticker. The top displays ways to access Channel NewsAsia online including social networks and breaking news when it happens.  The right side of the top bar also has information on stock market indices and currency exchange rates (on weekdays) and time information (on weekends), while the bottom continues to show content from the previous ticker. Graphics from various programs like [[Money Mind]] were also revamped, as well as the anchor lineups of certain programmes.

==Mga natatanging katangian==
When an interviewee gives his/her views in a language other than English, Channel NewsAsia does not superimpose the original audio with a voice translation unlike other news organisations.  Instead, an English subtitle appears preserving and complementing the original audio.  This includes programmes that use Mandarin, Japanese or Korean as their main language.  

Moreover, most news networks provide programmes for 24 hours a day but Channel NewsAsia closes down for around 3 hours (for Singapore viewers) or 3 1/2 hours (for international viewers) and will give text headlines until 6.00 HK/SIN time.

==Programa at Presents==
Channel NewsAsia is a news channel focusing primarily on Asian news and current affairs. Each of its news bulletins run for half-hour, starting at the top of the hour, except for ''Primetime Morning'', which runs for three consecutive hours. The bottom of the hour features [[documentaries]], lifestyle programming, [[health]] programming, current affairs and [[business]] news. The channel airs programmes 20 hours a day - with an extra 30 minutes for international viewers - seven days a week. Text of the latest news headlines are featured for the remaining four hours of the day except during major breaking news as was the case months following the September 11, 2001 attacks and the early days of the [[Iraq war]].

Channel NewsAsia now telecasts its flagship local news bulletin, ''Singapore Tonight'' to all its viewers, both locally in Singapore and internationally live. Parent company MediaCorp said the changes were made in response to requests from viewers in countries like [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Vietnam]], who have been asking for more in-depth content on Singapore. Previously, ''Singapore Tonight'' was made available internationally only on a replay basis at 2.00am (SIN/HK) and selected segments of that programme were shown on ''Asian Home News''.  During its run, ''Singapore Business Tonight'' was not regularly shown to international viewers prior to July 2008.  

Channel NewsAsia also produces news stories for the newscast on Singapore's only English-language general-entertainment channel, [[:en:MediaCorp Channel 5|MC5]].

==Mga feed at ticker==
Channel NewsAsia has two separate feeds, namely a Singapore feed - Channel NewsAsia Singapore - and a regional feed - Channel NewsAsia International. Both feeds have the almost the same programmes, especially since ''Singapore Tonight'' and ''Singapore Business Tonight'' started airing live internationally on July 7, 2008.  The exception to this is ''20/20'', which only airs in Singapore.  The Singapore feed airs a total of 20 hours of programmes while the international feed airs 30 minutes longer to include a replay of Singapore news.  As the station is about to sign-on and closedown, the national anthem is played in Singapore.  

Other important differences include a short, one-minute ''Singapore Update'' at various times of the day in the Singapore feed, the content of advertising where those in the Singaporean feed cater to local audiences, and the order in which magazine programmes/documentaries are aired within the week.  In addition, the Singaporean feed is supplemented by a [[Teletext]] service. Furthermore, during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], viewers in Singapore are given more highlights of the games than regional viewers.   

Channel NewsAsia's Singapore feed is available as a free-to-air television network in Singapore, hence cable or IPTV subscription isn't required to receive the channel.  Channel NewsAsia International is available on the [[AsiaSat 3S]] and [[Hot Bird]] satellites as well as various cable/satellite operators.  

The news and stock [[ticker]] tape is a permanent feature on Channel NewsAsia and, since August 2001, has not been taken off the air during commercials. This allows for uninterrupted viewing of the latest news and stock prices. Singapore viewers are given local news and live prices from the [[Singapore Exchange]] as well; regional viewers are given delayed stock prices from various regional exchanges. In addition, Singapore viewers do get a timepiece on ''Primetime Morning''.

===Relo at Sponsors sa relo sa harap ng mga balita===

''Ang karagdagang impormasyon: [[:en:Clock time|Clock time]]''

First aired on the CTV in 1984-85 and later to TTV in 1997), Happy 100 (now known as "100-Point Happiness) (Huan Le Yi Bai Dian) among others.
"
Current shows were shown are the popular Guess Guess Guess (Wo Cai Wo Cai Wo Cai Cai Cai), Variety Show Brothers (Zong Yi Da Ge Da), Go Go Jacky Show (Zhou Ri Ba Dian Dang).

China TV also shows the most classical martial arts dramas of all time through the years such as The Sacred Bow of Ling Mountain (Ling Shan Shen Jian), Return of the Condor Heroes, The Frontier Hero (Shen Zhou Xia Lu, also known as Condor Heroes II). It also shows the finest Asian dramas were shown such as NHK's "Oshin (Mandarin title as "A-Xing")", and "The Legend" from the MBC network of Korea starring Bae Yong-jun and Lee Ji-ah.

'''Chung T'ien Television''' (CTi TV, {{zh|t=中天電視}}), is a nationwide [[cable TV]] network based in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]. It belongs to the [[China Times]] group, which also owns [[China Television]] (CTV).

==History==
Founded in 1994, CTi TV was originally called the Chinese Television Network ({{zh|t=傳訊電視}}). CTN had two main channels, Zhong Tien ({{zh|c=中天頻道}}) and Da Di ({{zh|c=大地頻道}}). On January 30, 1997, ownership switched from Yu Pun Hoi, the current chairman of Nan Hai Corporation Limited (南海控股有限公司), to the KG Group (和信企業團). In 2000, ownership changed once again from KG Group to the Wisdom Group (象山集團), which, at the time, also operated [[China Television]]. Hsiang Shan merged CTN with CTV Satellite to form Power TV ({{zh|t=勁道數位電視}}). As part of Power TV, CTV Satellite became Chung T'ien Entertainment, while CTN's Zhong Tien split up into Power TV News ({{zh|t=中天新聞台}}) and Power TV Variety ({{zh|t=勁報電視台}}). Power News eventually changed its name to Chung T'ien Information, which then became Chung T'ien Main in January 2004. After the He Hsin-Hsiang Shan ownership transfer, Ta Ti was granted some degree of autonomy as Ta Ti Television; however, Da Di eventually became part of [[Videoland Television Network]], and changed its name to the Videoland Drama Channel. In June 2002, ownership of Power TV changed once again from Hsiang Shan to the [[China Times]]; Power TV changed its name to present-day Chung T'ien Television (CTi TV).

'''Taiwan Television Enterprise, Ltd.''' ({{zh|1=台灣電視公司}}), commonly known as '''TTV''' (formerly called Taiwan Radio (TR in 1962, TRA in 1967) in 1962, Taiwan Night Television (TNT) in 1969 when [[China Television|Taiwan Day Television]] (TDT) (Now CTV)) is launched), is the first television broadcast station in [[Taiwan]]. It was established on April 28, 1962 and started formally broadcasting later that year on [[Double Ten Day]], the [[Republic of China]]'s [[National Day|national holiday]].

[[Image:TTV 3 buildings 2010.jpg|thumb|TTV building in [[Taipei City]]]]
The station became home to many trailblazing and innovative shows at the time. Recently, the station enjoyed a resurgence in viewership when it inked a major contract with [[Sanlih E-Television]] to promote and air the latter's shows. TTV's pop idol dramas consistently rated high, although it sometimes went down or up depending on the storyline and the stars' appeal on these dramas.

Under current media reform laws, TTV is being tapped for full privatization. However the divestment of government shares in the station is being put on hold and placed under investigation at the moment due to irregularities in its transaction.

Since 1962, TTV began some of the milestones that changed the landscape of TTV presenting the very first Taiwanese-language TV serial as well as the first Mandarin drama anthology series. TTV presented the first costume drama serial "Zheng Chengong" (1963) starring Tsao Chien (Cao Jian) as the title role. In September 7, 1969 TTV is the first TV network broadcast in color and gave its chance to air the Apollo XI Landing (known as "Man on the Moon").

==The TTV Shows==

TTV Mandarin Novels (台視國語電視小說), the earliest TTV drama in Mandarin during the 1960s. It was the predecessor of today's Primetime drama serials that is now shown every night at 8PM.

Star Showcase (群星會), the earliest TTV variety show that lasted for 15 years from 1962 to 1977. It was revived in the early 1990s and again in 2002, but both of the newer versions lasted for less than six months.

Pentalight Talent Show (五燈獎), the longest TV talent show in Taiwan that lasted for 33 years from 1965 to 1998. Some of the popular singers in Taiwan started their careers in that said show.

Fu Pei-mei's Chinese Chooking Show (傅培梅時間), one of the most popular cooking shows in Taiwan hosted by the late Fu Pei-mei (1931-2004) ran for 40 years (1962 to 2002).

Yang Lihua Taiwanese Opera (楊麗花歌仔戲), one of TTV most popular Taiwanese opera TV serials in Taiwan showcasing Taiwanese Opera legend Yang Lihua. Began showing in the early evening slot from 1962 to 1975 and again from 1979 to 1994 where she also produces her Taiwanese opera works. In 1994, the show presented "The Goddess of the Luo River (a.k.a. "Mystical Enchantress") was the first Taiwanese opera series to hit on primetime slot at 8:00 PM. Then, a few series was produced sporadically from 1996 to 2003. The last one was "Ode to Its Successor" in 2003 where they earned an award in the 2004 Golden Bell Awards.

==Appearances==
=== Logo History ===
[[File:TTV cufflink.jpg|thumb|TTV 1st logo on a [[cufflink]] for senior executives of TTV]]
Since the beginning of TTV in 1962, the earliest known was a simple TV logo with the letters "TTV" in it; with the two Ts striking with a thunderbolt and a small V on a blue-green-red background. It was used until 1990 when it was replaced by a circular disk with an angular triangle inside the logo forming a satellite dish. The 1990 logo was used until recently in July 2008 when the present logo was revised with the same design but the triangle itself moves upward.

==Plot==
Detective Rita Rizzoli ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]) is an undercover crusading narcotics police officer who stages an undercover buy with drug dealer Tito Delgadillo, when during the bust she sees her friend and informant Charlene, who is also a prostitute being dragged out of the bar by her pimp and runs to her aid, alerting Delgadillo of being an undercover cop. After saving Charlene and shooting the pimp Rizzoli notices all the money used for the buy is missing along with Delgadillo who retreats to a warehouse in [[Los Angeles]], where a family of Asian immigrants is preparing plastic envelopes of imported [[cocaine]] stamped with the gang's brand name "Fatal Beauty". One worker, however, has been sampling too much of the drug and in his intoxicated state, prepares envelopes with a fatally high concentration of cocaine and a misaligned stamp. Delgadillo discovers the error but before they can correct it, the house is attacked by two small-time hoods, Leo Nova and Earl Skinner ([[Brad Dourif]] and [[Mike Jolly]]) who kill everyone within including Delgadillo and steal the lethal product.

Back at the police station, Rizzoli is chewed out by her boss Lt. Kellerman for blowing the bust to rescue her friend when he receives a call in which Rizzoli is needed at the warehouse where the drugs were being made. At the warehouse Rizzoli identifies Delgadillo as the only victim who authorities weren't able to identify because his face was mutilated during the attack. Rizzoli also discovers the new drug Fatal Beauty and Charlie Dawson's body which was stuffed in a van labeled "Kroll Enterprises". The next morning Rizzoli receives a call from Charlene sayings she is okay but needs a fix and asks for the money. When Rizzoli refuses Charlene offers some information about the drug slaying the previous night hoping to sway Rizzoli to give Charlene the money. Charlene tells Rizzoli only that there is a goon squad looking for the killers and the person who all the drugs belonged to drove a "rolls," prompting Rizzoli to pay a visit to Kroll’s home where she accuses him of drug dealing.

After leaving Kroll's home, Rizzoli hears a call for assistance over the scanner involving a police standoff. Realizing that the location is where her friend Carlene lives, she immediately rushes to the location. At the location a man who is hopped up on drugs emerges from Charlene's house and is shot several times but doesn't go down right away. After the man finally falls to the ground and dies Rizzoli, immediately runs into Charlene's house where she attempts to resuscitate Charlene with no success. Rizzoli is told by a boy at the location that both Charlene and the guy who was shot "big bubba," were both taken out by the new dope and that they got it from Charlene's new pimp named "Jimmy" who hangs out at the fern bars on Melrose Place and looks like Richard Gear. Rizzoli and her partner Detective Jimenez head down that part of town and find him in a restaurant, when Rizzoli places him under arrest he retreats and is shot in the butt by her. After hanging him up in the freezer and threatening more bodily harm Rizzoli is able to get him to reveal that he purchased the drugs from a buy house from a guy name Rafael. Rizzoli heads to the buy house the pimp told her about and is greeted by a guy named Epifanio who tells her he will get her what she wants. She is able to get Epifanio to take her to Rafeal, but a hood from the night she staged the bust with Delgadillo recognizes her as a cop and immediately alerts Nova and Skinner. Rizzoli is  able to get locked in a room with Rafeal, where she gets Rafeal to admit he is fronting for Nova and Skinner right as he is blown away by his crew trying to kill Rizzoli. Marshak shows up at the buy house to help Rizzoli altering her has been following her around since the night before by a transmitter under her bumper. Rizzoli and Marshak come close to apprehending Nova and Skinner when a section of the a roof collapses on Rizzoli and Marshak immediately runs to her aid, letting Nova and Skinner escape.

Rizzoli is taken to nearby hospital where Marshak goes to visit her. Upon walking into Rizzoli's room, Marshak sees Rizzoli and Jiminez going over the mug shots of Nova and Skinner and Jiminez immediately leaves after Marshak's arrival. When Jiminez goes toward the elevator he notices Nova from the mug shot carrying a package and orders him to freeze. Nova pulls out a shotgun from the package and fires at Jiminez, missing him. After getting into an argument about what Marshak's boss Kroll is allegedly doing, Rizzoli agrees to let Marshak driver home. When they at her home{{Clarify|date=:en:March 2010}}, Rizzoli notices her cat on the roof and explains to Marshak about her cat's fear of heights and her front door being open. They both go into her residence see Zack Yeager asleep. Yeager tells Rizolli about how all his friends were dead from consuming Fatal Beauty. This is further confirmed when he, Rizzoli and Marshak arrive at the home of one of the kids who threw the party and finds them all lying dead in the living room. Yeager tells Rizolli he got the drugs from his mom Cecille. When Rizzoli goes to Cecille in an attempt to get information about where the drugs came from, Rizzoli is attacked by Cecille and the two get into a physical altercation until Marshak arrives to break it up and takes Rizolli home. At home Rizzoli invites Marshak into her house for some coffee and receives a phone call that four young children had died from Fatal Beauty, Rizzoli then has a breakdown and Marshak comforts her as she tells him about her own past as a junkie and about her daughter, who had died when she had gotten into her drug stash and drowned in a swimming pool. When Rizzoli takes a shower and receives a call during her shower she notices Marshak has left and that he went through her police files of the suspects she was after. At the point Rizzoli learns that Kroll had sent Marshak not to protect Rizzoli like he said earlier but to spy on her to find out the people were that ripped him off.

Rizzoli receives a call from Cecille learning that Zack had cut his wrist and was in the hospital. Cecille asks Rizzoli to meet her at the hospital where she reveals who she bought the drugs from and that her supplier, Denny Mifflin will be making a pickup from his suppliers Nova and Skinner at Kroll Plaza. Rizzoli and Jiminez head to Kroll plaza and are spotted by Kroll's security team. Rizolli and Jiminez are watching Mifflin and Rizolli orders Jiminez to get the drugs away from some kids that they spotted Mifflin selling to. When Jiminez gets the drugs from the kids he is knocked out by one of Kroll's security guards. When Kroll is alerted to Rizzoli's presence, Marshak who is with Kroll notices Nova and Skinner entering the plaza. Kroll orders one of his guards to take out Nova and Skinner and then orders Marshak to take out Rizzoli. Rizzoli meanwhile notices Nova, Skinner, Mifflin and his bodyguard, Frankenstein, coming to together and follows them into a store. Rizzoli is followed into the store by Krolls security team with their guns drawn. Just as Rizzoli is about to bust Nova, Skinner, Mifflin and Frankenstein she is accosted by Marshak who warns her it is a wipeout in which all five of them are going to be killed. Rizzoli then punches Marshak which spooks Nova, Skinner, Mifflin and Frankenstein. After stabbing one of the security men, Frankenstein is shot several times in the chest at close range by one of the security guards and dies seconds later while calling to Miffkin for help. Rizzoli then shoots Mifflin after he fires at her. Rizzoli and the security guards pursuit Nova and Skinner, who open fire in the mall, killing several guards and then retreat into a store, Rizzoli and more security guards follow them into the store. The security guards are shot and killed by Nova and Skinner except for one which is shot and killed by Rizzoli as he is attempting to kill her. After Rizzoli kills the guard and steals his gun, the shelf he was standing on collapses on her and Skinner shows up getting ready to kill Rizzoli when Skinner is killed by Marshak. After killing Skinner, Marshak is shot by Nova who is then shot and injured by Rizzoli and retreats from the store. Rizzoli pursues Nova and runs into Kroll who is about to shot and kill her when Nova jumps out of a hiding place and shoots and kills Kroll. Rizzoli follows Nova into a parking garage and shoots him several times unable to injure him. After Nova reveals to Rizzoli he was wearing a bullet-proof vest this whole time Rizolli pulls out a gun she stole from the dead guard and shots Nova in the throat killing him.

==Reception==
The film was unpopular with many of critics (though [[Roger Ebert]] gave it a positive review of 3 stars), some of whom considered it a rip-off of ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' (which Faltermeyer also scored); others cited a lack of chemistry in the interracial romance between Goldberg and Elliott's characters. Movie historian [[Leonard Maltin]] called it "inexcusably awful, with gratuitous violence and mind-boggling dialogue, using an anti-drug message to rationalize its excesses."

'''Formosa TV''' ({{zh|t=民間全民電視公司，民視|s=民间全民电视公司，民视|p=Mínjiān Quánmín Diànshì Gōngsī Mín Shì}}) is a [[television station]] based in [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taiwan]]. Established on March 27, 1996, FTV began broadcasting on June 11, 1997. 

The station was wholly owned and operated by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]<ref>*Copper, J. (2000). ''Historical Dictionary of Taiwan (Republic of China)''. The Scarecrow Press. ISBN 0810836653</ref>. Due to this, its news programs are often of a [[Pan-Green]] perspective. Because of the location of its headquarters, which is in an area where  [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]]-speakers are populous, it also earned the reputation for being the first station in Taiwan to use that tongue in a majority of its programs, especially on their prime time newscasts. 

On May 24, 2004, FTV was among the first free-to-air channels on Taiwan to switch from [[Analogue television|terrestrial analogue signal]] to [[digital television]].<ref>{{en icon}} [http://investintaiwan.nat.gov.tw/en/news/200406/2004063007.html Five major TV broadcasters begin switch to digital television] June 30, 2004.

'''''Casino Royale''''' (2006) is the 21st film in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond film series]] and the first to star [[Daniel Craig]] as MI6 agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]].  It was directed by [[Martin Campbell]] and written by [[Neal Purvis]], [[Robert Wade (screenwriter)|Robert Wade]], and [[Paul Haggis]].  ''Casino Royale'' is set at the beginning of Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his [[license to kill (concept)|licence to kill]]. After preventing a terrorist attack at [[Miami International Airport]], Bond falls for [[Vesper Lynd]], the treasury agent assigned to provide the money he needs to foil [[Le Chiffre]]'s plans by beating him in a high-stakes poker game.  The [[story arc]] continues in the following Bond film, ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' (2008).

The film is a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]], establishing a new timeline and narrative framework not meant to precede or succeed any previous Bond film.<ref>{{Cite web|title=IGN: Interview: Campbell on Casino Royale|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/659/659741p1.html|work=IGN.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc|date=19 October 2005|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>  This allowed the film to show a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/entertainment/061116_bond_review.html |title=New James Bond Proves Worthy of Double-0 Status |accessdate=2007-06-16 |work=[[Space.com]] |date=21 October 2006}}</ref>  Casting the film involved a widespread search for a new actor to portray James Bond, and significant controversy around Craig when he was selected to succeed [[Pierce Brosnan]] in October 2005.  Location filming took place in the Bahamas, Italy, and the United Kingdom with interior sets built at Pinewood Studios.  ''Casino Royale'' was produced by [[EON Productions]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], making it the first official Bond film to be co-produced by the latter studio.  It is the third screen adaptation of [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1953 [[Casino Royale (novel)|novel of the same name]], which was previously produced as a [[Casino Royale (Climax!)|1954 television episode]] and a [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|1967 satirical film]].

''Casino Royale'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on November 14, 2006.  It received largely positive critical response, with reviewers highlighting Craig's performance and the reinvention of the character of Bond.  It earned over $594 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing James Bond film to date.

==Plot==
In the opening sequence, James Bond is on a mission that, if successful, will qualify him for [[00 Agent|double-0 status]]. He goes to [[Prague]] and kills an [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] section chief, [[List of James Bond henchmen in Casino Royale#Dryden|Dryden]], who has leaked classified information, and his ally, [[List of James Bond henchmen in Casino Royale#Fisher|Fisher]]. Elsewhere, [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] serves as a middleman introducing a banker, [[Le Chiffre]], to a guerrilla group seeking a safe haven for its funds. Le Chiffre assures them that there is "no risk in the portfolio", but his investments actually involve considerable risk: he [[short (finance)|short-sells]] stock in successful companies and then engineers terrorist attacks to sink their share prices.

In his first mission as Agent 007, Bond goes to [[Madagascar]] in pursuit of an international bomb-maker named [[Mollaka]]. After a [[free running]] chase to the [[List of fictional countries|Nambutu]] embassy, Bond kills his target and blows up a part of the building in order to escape. He obtains Mollaka's mobile phone and discovers that it has received calls from [[Alex Dimitrios]], an associate of Le Chiffre in the [[Bahamas]]. Bond travels there and seduces Dimitros' wife, [[Solange Dimitrios|Solange]]. While answering a phone call, Solange reveals that her husband is flying to [[Miami]]. Bond leaves to pursue him. In Miami, 007 kills Dimitrios and then follows Le Chiffre's henchman, [[Carlos]], to the Miami Airport. There, Bond foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype [[List of James Bond vehicles#Aircraft|''Skyfleet'' airliner]] and thus leaves the banker with a major loss.

Now under pressure to recoup his clients' money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes [[Texas hold 'em]] tournament at the Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]]. Hoping that a defeat would force Le Chiffre to aid the [[British government]] in exchange for protection from his creditors, MI6 enters Bond into the tournament. He meets up with Mathis, his ally in Montenegro, and Vesper Lynd, a Treasury agent, who is assigned to look after his handling of the $10 million [[buy-in]]. After the tournament is underway for some time, Bond loses his initial stake. Vesper says that it would be a waste of money to continue to stake Bond and refuses to give him the $5 million he needs for a re-buy so he can continue playing.

Distraught over his failure, Bond resolves to assassinate Le Chiffre. Before he can, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Felix Leiter, who is also playing in the tournament, intervenes and offers to stake Bond in exchange for custody of Le Chiffre. Back in the game, Bond begins to amass chips. Le Chiffre and his associates attempt to kill Bond by poisoning his drink, but he survives and wins the tournament. Soon afterward, Le Chiffre abducts Vesper and uses her to lure Bond into a near-fatal car chase, which results in his capture as well. Le Chiffre tortures Bond's genitals for the access code to the game's winnings. When it becomes clear that Bond will not give in, Le Chiffre advances to castrate him, but Mr. White enters and kills Le Chiffre and his associates for their failure. Bond and Vesper are left alive.

Bond awakens in a hospital on [[Lake Como]] and orders Mathis, whom Le Chiffre identified as a [[double agent]], arrested. Bond admits his love for Vesper and vows to quit the service before it strips him of his humanity. Accordingly, he posts his resignation to M and goes on a romantic holiday in Venice with Vesper. However, Bond soon learns that his poker winnings were never deposited in the Treasury's account. Realizing that Vesper has stolen them, he pursues her and members of the organization she is working for into a building under renovation. After killing the enemy guards outside and inside the building, Bond finds Vesper imprisoned in an elevator. Apologizing to him tearfully, she locks the inside door and the elevator plunges underwater. Bond attempts to rescue her, but she drowns before he can reach her. Mr. White, watching from a balcony, walks away with the money.

Bond, feeling betrayed, learns from M that Vesper had a French-Algerian boyfriend who was kidnapped by the organization behind Le Chiffre and Mr. White and that she agreed to deliver the money only if they would consent to leave Bond alive. He then discovers White's name and number in Vesper's mobile phone. White, arriving at a palatial estate near Lake Como, receives a phone call. As soon as he answers, he is shot in the leg. As he painfully crawls towards the villa, Bond appears, gun in hand, and responds, "The name's Bond. James Bond."

''Casino Royale'' includes a cameo by British entrepreneur [[Richard Branson]] (seen being frisked at Miami airport). The cameo was cut out of the in-flight versions shown on all airlines' in-flight entertainment systems, as was a shot of the [[Virgin Atlantic]] aircraft Branson supplied.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6579839.stm |title=BA cuts Branson from Bond movie |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=21 April 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref>

==Production==
[[EON Productions]] gained the rights for ''Casino Royale'' in 1999 after [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] exchanged them for [[MGM]]'s rights to ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Sony Pictures, in an accord with MGM, drops its plan to produce new James Bond movies |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 March 1999 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30814FC35540C738FDDAA0894D1494D81&n=Top%2fNews%2fBusiness%2fSmall%20Business%2fMarketing%20and%20Advertising |accessdate=2007-06-20 | first=James | last=Sterngold}}</ref> In March 2004, [[Neal Purvis]] and [[Robert Wade (screenwriter)|Robert Wade]] began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming to bring back an Ian Fleming flavor.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Purvis & Wade Talk Bond & Jinx |work=[[MI6.co.uk]] |date=9 March 2004 |url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/event_purvis_wade_talk.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21 |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> [[Paul Haggis]]' main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. He explained, "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that Vesper had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her."<ref>{{Cite news|first=Mark |last=Lawson |title=Paul Haggis |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=4 December 2007 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/dec/04/guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank1 |accessdate=2007-12-07 | location=London}}</ref>

Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] expressed interest in directing an adaptation of the ''Casino Royale'' novel,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Kill Bill director aims for Bond |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=16 May 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3718975.stm |accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> though this was only a personal interest, and he did not follow this up with EON. Tarantino also expressed interest ''Casino Royale'' after ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''. He claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believed this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with ''Casino Royale''.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Chris |last=Heath |title=Quentin Tarantino Interview |work=[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]] |date=June 2007}}</ref> In February 2005, Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director.<ref>{{Cite web|author=EON Productions |title=James Bond 21 Is Casino Royale |work=[[MI6.co.uk]] |date=3 February 2005 |url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/bond_21_announced.php3 |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> Later in 2005, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Consortium Led by Sony Corporation of America, Providence Equity Partners, Texas Pacific Group, Comcast Corporation and DLJ Merchant Banking Partners Enters into Definitive Agreement to Acquire Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer |publisher=Sony Corporation |date=23 September 2004 |url=http://www.sony.com/SCA/press/040924.shtml |accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>

EON admitted that they had relied too heavily on [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects in the more recent films, particularly ''[[Die Another Day]]'', and were keen to accomplish the stunts in ''Casino Royale'' "the old fashioned way".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Alberge |first=Dayla |title=Fake stunts banished as new Bond keeps it real |work=[[The Times]] |date=14 March 2006 |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/film/article2433165.ece |accessdate=2006-11-21 | location=London}}</ref> In keeping with this drive for more realism, screenwriters Purvis, Wade, and Haggis wanted the script to follow as closely as possible to the original 1953 novel, keeping Fleming's darker storyline and characterisation of Bond.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Jon |last=Silberg |title=High Stakes for 007 |work=[[American Cinematographer]] |date = December 2006|url=http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/December2006/CasinoRoyale/page1.php |accessdate=2007-04-17 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070402131840/http://www.ascmag.com/magazine_dynamic/December2006/CasinoRoyale/page1.php |archivedate=April 2, 2007}}</ref>

''Casino Royale'' became the first Bond film to take its title from a Fleming novel or short story since 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. It is also the first Bond film since then not to be adapted as a [[novelization|novelisation]]. Instead, a film [[tie-in]] edition of Fleming's original novel was published.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Casino Royale (movie tie-in) (James Bond OO7) (Paperback) |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |date=31 October 2006 |url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143037668 |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref>

===Casting===
[[Pierce Brosnan]] had originally signed a deal for four films when he was cast in the role of James Bond. This was fulfilled with the production of ''[[Die Another Day]]'' in 2002. However, at this stage Brosnan was approaching his 50th birthday, and speculation began that the producers were seeking to replace him with a younger actor.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Is Brosnan too old to be 007? |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-207653/Is-Brosnan-old-007.html |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=9 February 2004 |accessdate=2008-08-05 | location=London}}</ref> Brosnan officially announced he was stepping down in February 2005. At one point producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] claimed there was a list of over 200 names being considered for his replacement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4337224.stm |title=Michael G.

In May 2005, [[Daniel Craig]] announced that MGM and producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured him that he would get the role of Bond, and [[Matthew Vaughn]] told reporters that MGM offered him the opportunity to direct, but EON Productions at that point had not approached either of them.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Craig, Vaughn on Bond |url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/609/609721p1.html |work=[[IGN]] |date=3 May 2005 |accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> A year beforehand, Craig rejected the offer as he felt the series had descended into [[formula fiction|formula]]: only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited [[Mossad]] and [[British Secret Service]] agents who served as advisors on the set of ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' as inspiring because, "Bond has just come out of the service and he's a killer. [...] You can see it in their eyes, you know immediately: oh, hello, he's a killer. There's a look. These guys walk into a room and very subtly they check the perimeters for an exit. That's the sort of thing I wanted."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Daniel Craig: Quantum of Solace |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=11 October 2008 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/10/11/sm_danielcraig111.xml |accessdate=2008-10-11 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Grant}}</ref>

On 14 October 2005, EON Productions, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and MGM announced at a press conference in London that Craig would be the sixth actor to portray James Bond.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/oct/14/film.filmnews |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |title=Daniel Craig confirmed as 006th screen Bond |accessdate=2007-05-15 | location=London | date=2005-10-14}}</ref> A tuxedo-clad Craig arrived via a [[Royal Navy]] speedboat.<ref name="craigarrival">{{Cite web|url=http://shatterhand007.com/MadRoyale/MADROYALEDanielCraig007.wmv |title=Film of the arrival |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> Significant controversy followed the decision, as it was doubted if the producers had made the right choice.

The next important casting was that of the lead [[Bond girl]], Vesper Lynd. Casting director Debbie McWilliams acknowledged that Hollywood actresses [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Charlize Theron]] were "strongly considered" for the role and that Belgian actress [[Cécile de France]] had also auditioned, but her [[English English|English accent]] "wasn't up to scratch."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Casino Royale Bond girl candidates |work=[[MI6.co.uk]] |date=7 July 2006 |url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/bond_21_girl_casting_rumours.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> [[Audrey Tautou]] was also considered, but not chosen because of her role in ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'' that was released in May 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/jamesbondnews.php?id=4470 |title=The New Bond Girls! |work=[[Superhero Hype!]] |date=7 July 2006 |accessdate=2006-03-04}}</ref> It was announced on February 16, 2006 that [[Eva Green]] would play the part.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.imdb.com/news/sb/2006-02-17#film5 |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] |title=New Bond Girl Will Be "Very Much an Equal to Bond" |accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

===Filming===

Principal photography for ''Casino Royale'' commenced on 30 January 2006 and concluded on 21 July 2006. The film was primarily shot at [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague, with additional location shooting in the [[Bahamas]], Italy, and the United Kingdom. The shoot concluded at [[Pinewood Studios]].<ref name="Real">{{cite video|title=James Bond: For Real |medium=DVD |publisher=Special Treats Productions |date=2006}}</ref>

In addition to the extensive location filming, studio work including choreography and stunt coordination practice was performed at the Barrandov Studios in Prague and at Pinewood Studios where the film used several stages as well as the paddock tank and the historic [[007 Stage]]. Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for [[Dunsfold]] Aerodrome in [[Surrey]], the cricket pavilion at [[Eton College]] (although that particular scene was cut from the completed movie) and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in [[Bedfordshire]].<ref name="Location2"/>

After Prague, the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around [[New Providence]] were used for filming during February and March, particularly on Paradise Island. Footage set in [[Mbale]], Uganda was filmed at Black Park, Country Park in Buckinghamshire on 4 July 2006. Additional scenes took place at Albany House, an estate owned by golfers [[Ernie Els]] and [[Tiger Woods]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=James Bond takes over Ernie and Tiger's pad |publisher=Ernie Els Official Website |date=12 June 2006 |url=http://www.ernieels.com/search.aspx?i_MediaEntryID=506 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060618111857/http://www.ernieels.com/search.aspx?i_MediaEntryID=506 |archivedate=2006-06-18 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> The crew returned to the Czech Republic in April, and continued there, filming in Prague, [[Planá (Tachov District)|Planá]] and [[Loket]], before completing in the town of [[Karlovy Vary]] in May.

A recreation of the [[Body Worlds]] exhibit provided a setting for one scene in the film. Among the Body Worlds plastinates featured in that scene were the ''[http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/preview.html?id=78 Poker Playing Trio]'' (which plays a key role in one scene) and ''[http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/preview.html?id=129 Rearing Horse and Rider]''.

On 30 July 2006, a fire broke out at the 007 Stage. The damage was significant, but had no effect on the release of ''Casino Royale'' as the incident occurred one week after filming had been completed, and the sets were in the process of being dismantled.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Fire wrecks James Bond film stage |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=30 July 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5228794.stm |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> On 11 August 2006, Pinewood Studios confirmed that no attempt would be made to salvage the remains of the stage,<ref>{{Cite news|title=007 stage destroyed by fire |work=[[MI6.co.uk]] |date=30 July 2006 |url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/event_pinewood_fire.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> instead it would be rebuilt from scratch.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Pinewood receives planning permission to rebuild 007 stage, bigger than ever next year |work=[[MI6.co.uk]] |date=21 September 2006 |url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=4114&catid=4 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref>

===Effects===
In designing the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer [[Daniel Kleinman]] was inspired by the cover of the 1953 British first edition of ''Casino Royale'', which featured Ian Fleming's original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood. Kleinman said, "The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles," like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Credits design |url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=4511 |work=[[MI6.co.uk]] |date=6 December 2006 |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitised the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at [[Framestore CFC]] in London; the actors' silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns. Kleinman decided not to use the female silhouettes commonly seen throughout the Bond title sequences, considering that the women did not fit with both the film's spirit and the storyline following Bond falling in love.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Design / Casino Royale's Title Sequence|publisher=[[Framestore]] |url=http://www.framestore.com/#/Design/CasinoRoyale,TitleSequence |accessdate=2010-01-29}}</ref>

For the rest of the film, Special Effects and Miniature Effects Supervisor [[Chris Corbould]] returned to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduce digital effects. According to Corbould, "CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It’s the best way to go".<ref name="Real"/> Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the [[Miami Airport]] chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios.<ref name="Real"/>

First on the schedule were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.<ref name="Real"/> In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger, and reinforced with steel.<ref name="Real"/>

The sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the [[Dunsfold#Dunsfold Park|Dunsfold Aerodrome]] in Surrey, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports.<ref name="Real"/> In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden, and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.<ref name="Real"/>

The Skyfleet S570 aircraft in the film was an ex-British Airways 747-200B G-BDXJ which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film.  The modified aircraft had the outboard engines replaced by external fuel tanks, while the inboard engines were replaced by a mockup pair of engines on each inboard pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0297.shtml |title=Boeing 747 in Casino Royale}}</ref> The plane used can be seen on the BBC Motoring programme ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' on the [[Top Gear Test Track|Test Track]].

The sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film.<ref name="Real"/> For the scene involving Bond following Vesper into the house undergoing renovation supported by inflatable balloons, a tank was constructed at the 007 stage at Pinewood, consisting of a Venetian piazza and the interior of the three-story dilapidated house. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves which were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model which the effects team built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model elevator within the rig could be immersed in {{convert|19|ft|m}} of water, and used banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.<ref name="Real"/>

The scene involving the car crash was devised using an [[Aston Martin DB9]] that was especially modified to look like Bond's [[Aston Martin DBS V12]] and reinforced to withstand the impact. Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450&nbsp;mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at [[Millbrook Proving Ground]]s and stunt driver Adam Kirley had to use an air cannon located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding <span style="white-space:nowrap">70&nbsp;mph&nbsp;(113&nbsp;km/h)</span>, the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] on 5 November 2006 as a new [[world record]].<ref name="Real"/>

===Music===

The soundtrack of ''Casino Royale'', released by [[Sony Classical]] on 14 November 2006 featured music composed by veteran composer [[David Arnold]], his fourth soundtrack for the Bond film series, while Nicholas Dodd orchestrated and conducted the [[Film score|score]]. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on 26 July 2006 that [[Chris Cornell]], who was the lead singer for [[Audioslave]] and [[Soundgarden]], composed and performed the title song "[[You Know My Name]]".<ref>{{cite press release|first=Steve |last=Elzer |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/07-26-2006/0004404210&EDATE= |title=Chris Cornell Has Written and Will Perform the Main Title Song for Casino Royale |publisher=Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group |date=26 July 2006 |accessdate=2006-07-26}}</ref> The song's main notes are played throughout the film as a substitute for the [[James Bond theme]], to represent Bond's immaturity.

==Release==
''Casino Royale'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]], the [[Odeon West End]] and the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire]] simultaneously in London on 14 November 2006. It marked the 60th Royal Film Performance and benefited the Cinema & Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), whose patron, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], was in attendance at with the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]].

Only two days following the premiere, pirated copies appeared for sale in London. "The rapid appearance of this film on the streets shows the sophistication and organisation behind film piracy in the UK," said Kieron Sharp, from the [[Federation Against Copyright Theft]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6157066.stm |title=Studio claims 007 box office coup |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=17 November 2006 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> Pirated copies of the DVD were selling for less than £1.57.

In January 2007, ''Casino Royale'' became the first Bond film ever to be shown in mainland Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the Cold War re-dubbed and new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of [[Texas Hold'em]], as the game is less familiar in China (this addition is reminiscent of dialogue that was added to the 1954 American TV adaptation in order to explain the rules of [[baccarat]], the game featured in the original book). ''Casino Royale'' earned approximately $11.7 million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Casino Royale (2006) - International Box Office |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=jamesbond21.htm| accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref> including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5 million.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Dave McNary |title=China shows 007 the love |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117958463.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&query=casino+royale |date=31 January 2007 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref>

After critics dubbed ''[[Die Another Day]]'' "Buy Another Day" because of around twenty [[product placement]] deals, EON limited their promotions for ''Casino Royale''. Partners included Ford Motors, [[Heineken Pilsener]] (which [[Eva Green]] starred in adverts for), [[Smirnoff]], [[Omega SA]], [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]] and [[Sony Ericsson]].<ref>{{Cite news|first=Marc |last=Graser |title=Brands line up for Bond sequel |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=14 August 2008 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117990584.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref>

===Box office===
The film achieved [[Pound sterling|GB£]]2  million of ticket sales in the UK on its first day of release. Weekend opening total in the UK was GB£13,400,000. The film also opened in the [[Republic of Ireland]] with over [[euro|€]]1,100,000 in the first 2 weeks. Altogether the film took about €4,200,000 in Ireland. From 16 November to 19 November 2006, the film took in over $40,000,000.<ref name=numbers>{{Cite web|title=Box Office History for James Bond Movies |work=The Numbers |url=http://the-numbers.com/movies/series/JamesBond.php |accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref>

Opening day estimates in the United States and Canada showed ''Casino Royale'' on top with $14,750,000, while opening weekend estimates showed it in second place with $40,600,000,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Casino Royale grosses $40.6 million |work=[[Superhero Hype!]] |date=19 November 2006 |url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/jamesbondnews.php?id=4922 |accessdate=2006-11-19}}</ref> as well as earning another $42,000,000 internationally. Although ''[[Happy Feet]]'' won the overall weekend box office contest, the significance of such a comparison in earnings is problematic, as ''Happy Feet'' has little more than half the running time of ''Casino Royale'', and therefore had significantly more screenings per day, which translates into more potential gross. A better indication of the film's relative performances is that ''Casino Royale'', per theatre, outperformed ''Happy Feet'', which was released in 370 more theatres. According to [[Box Office Mojo]], ''Casino Royale'' took in, on average, $11,890 per theatre, while ''Happy Feet'' grossed $10,918 per theatre.<ref name="BOM-CR">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jamesbond21.htm |title=Casino Royale (2006) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=happyfeet.htm |title=Happy Feet (2006) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref>

Accounting for [[inflation]], ''Casino Royale'' is currently the fifth most successful of all [[James Bond films]], behind ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', and ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''.  It achieved the highest inflation-adjusted [[gross (economics)|gross]] for a [[James Bond]] film since 1977.

==Reception==
===Reviews===
Critics gave the film a positive response, in particular Craig's performance and credibility. During production this had been subject to debate by the media and the public, as Craig did not appear to fit Ian Fleming's original portrait of the character as tall, dark, and suave. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' compared the quality of Craig's characterization of Bond to [[Sean Connery]]'s and praised the script as smartly written, noting how the film departed from the series' conventions. ''[[The Times]]'' compared the more assertive portrayal by Craig to [[Timothy Dalton]], and praised the action as edgy,<ref>{{Cite news|title="Brilliant" Bond seduces critics |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=4 November 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6116286.stm?ls |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> with another reviewer citing in particular the action sequence involving the cranes in Madagascar.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Stuart |last=Wavell |title=Potato Head shoots way to 007 triumph |work=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=5 November 2006 |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article167203.ece |accessdate=2006-11-21 | location=London}}</ref> Critics Paul Arendt of BBC Films,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Arendt |first=Paul |title=Casino Royale (2006) |work=[[bbc.co.uk]] |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/11/06/casino_royale_2006_review.shtml |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> [[Kim Newman]] of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''<ref>{{Cite web|last=Newman |first=Kim |authorlink=Kim Newman |title=Casino Royale |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire Online]] |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=10199 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> and Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''<ref name=variety>{{Cite news|last=McCarthy |first=Todd |title=Casino Royale |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=http://www.variety.com/VE1117932077.html |accessdate=2006-11-21 | date=2006-11-09}}</ref> all described Craig as the first actor to truly embody Ian Fleming's James Bond from the original novel: ironic, brutal, and cold.

Vicky Allan of the ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' noted Bond himself, and not his love interests, was sexually objectified in this film. A moment where he rises from the sea is reminiscent of [[Ursula Andress]] in ''Dr. No''; he feels "skewered" by Vesper Lynd's criticism of him; "and though it would be almost unthinkable now have a female character in a mainstream film stripped naked and threatened with genital mutilation, that is exactly what happens to Bond in [the film]." So although the film backed off from past criticism of Bond girls being sex objects, "the once invincible James Bond becomes just another joint at the meat market".<ref>{{Cite news|first=Vicky |last=Allan |title=For your eyes only? |publisher=[[Sunday Herald]] |date=27 October 2008 |url=http://www.sundayherald.com/arts/arts/display.var.2463325.0.0.php |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> This sentiment is shared by the [[University of Leicester]]'s James Chapman, author of ''License to Thrill'', who also notes Craig's Bond is "not yet the polished article"; he felt his incarnation of Bond is close to Fleming's because he is "humourless", but is also different because "Fleming's Bond did not enjoy killing; Craig's Bond seems almost to relish it."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Daniel Craig's Bond "relishes killing", professor claims |publisher=In the news |date=28 October 2008 |url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/printerfriendly.aspx?itemid=1246720|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>

[[Roger Moore]] wrote, "Daniel Craig impressed me so greatly in his debut outing, ''Casino Royale'', by introducing a more gritty, unrefined edge to the character that I thought [[Sean Connery|Sean]] might just have to move over. Craig’s interpretation was like nothing we’d seen on screen before; Jimmy Bond was earning his stripes and making mistakes. It was intriguing to see him being castigated by M, just like a naughty schoolboy would be by his headmaster. The script showed him as a vulnerable, troubled and flawed character. Quite the opposite to my Bond! Craig was, and is, very much the Bond Ian Fleming had described in the books – a ruthless killing machine. It was a Bond that the public wanted." So impressed was Moore that he chose to buy the DVD.<ref>{{Cite news|authorlink=Roger Moore |first=Roger |last=Moore |title=Bye bye to Ian Fleming's James Bond? |work=[[The Times]] |date=4 October 2008 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/london_film_festival/article4866756.ece |accessdate=2008-10-05 | location=London |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rrWp8oPN |archivedate=2010-08-09}}</ref> [[Raymond Benson]], the author of nine Bond novels, called ''Casino Royale'' "a perfect Bond film."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/20-JAMES-BOND-AUTHOR-RAYMOND-BENSON-REVIEWS-THE-ULTIMATE.html |title=JAMES BOND AUTHOR RAYMOND BENSON REVIEWS THE ULTIMATE - Cinema Retro - Celebrating Films of the 1960s & 1970s |publisher=Cinema Retro |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>

However, the film met with mixed reactions from other critics.

Though American radio personality [[Michael Medved]] gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as "intriguing, audacious and very original... more believable and less cartoonish, than previous 007 extravaganzas," he commented that the "sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some Bond fanatics."<ref>{{Cite news|authorlink=Michael Medved |first=Michael |last=Medved |title=Casino Royale |publisher=[[Townhall.com]]|url=http://townhall.com/TalkRadio/Show.aspx?RadioShowID=4&ContentGuid=43306526-93fb-41b5-80aa-44ec67611670|accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref> Similarly, a reviewer for ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' praised the film for its darkness and Craig's performance, but felt that "like the novel, it suffers from a lack of sharpness in the plot" and believed that it required additional editing, particularly the finale.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The best Bond since Connery |work=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] |date=20 October 2006 |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006480716,00.html |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> Commentators such as [[Emanuel Levy]] concurred, feeling the ending was too long, and that the film's terrorist villains lacked depth, although he praised Craig and gave the film a B+ overall.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Levy |first=Emanuel |title=Casino Royale B+ |publisher=Emanuel Levy |url=http://www.emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=3668 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> Other reviewers responded negatively, including Tim Adams of ''[[The Observer]]'' who felt the film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make the series grittier.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Adams |first=Tim |title=You might be shaken, but this Bond won't leave you stirred |work=[[The Observer]] |date=5 November 2006 |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1939830,00.html |accessdate=2006-11-21 | location=London}}</ref>

'''''Quantum of Solace''''' ([[2008 in film|2008]]) is the 22nd [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond film]], produced by [[EON Productions]] and is the direct [[sequel]] to the 2006 film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. Directed by [[Marc Forster]], it features [[Daniel Craig]]'s second performance as [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. In the film, Bond battles wealthy businessman [[Dominic Greene]] ([[Mathieu Amalric]]), a member of the [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] organization<!-- Organisation is the British spelling of organization, and the article uses British spelling --> posing as an [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] who intends to stage a [[coup d'état]] in [[Bolivia]] to seize control of the nation's water supply. (In fact, the story is remarkably similar to a [[2000 Cochabamba protests|real-life event]] in which [[Bechtel#Bolivia|Bechtel]] was the major player.) Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, [[Vesper Lynd]] ([[Eva Green]]), and is assisted by [[Camille Montes]] ([[Olga Kurylenko]]), who is also seeking revenge.

Producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] developed the film's plot while ''Casino Royale'' was being shot. [[Neal Purvis]], [[Robert Wade (screenwriter)|Robert Wade]], [[Paul Haggis]], and [[Joshua Zetumer]] contributed to the script. The title was chosen from a 1960 short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', though the film does not contain any elements of the original story. Location filming took place in [[Mexico]], [[Panama]], [[Chile]], [[Italy]], [[Austria]], and [[Wales]] while interior sets were built and filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]]. Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage [[Douglas DC-3]] was used for a dogfight sequence, and [[Dennis Gassner]]'s set designs are reminiscent of [[Ken Adam]]'s work on several early Bond films. Taking a course away from the usual [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villains]], Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasize the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.

The film premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 29 October 2008, gathering mixed reviews which mainly praised Craig's gritty performance and the film's action sequences while feeling that ''Quantum of Solace'' was not as impressive as the predecessor ''Casino Royale''. It is also the second highest grossing James Bond film, without adjusting for inflation, making $586,090,727 worldwide, while becoming one of the highest grossing Bond films in the United States.

==Plot==
<!-- Please remember to keep it short and around 600 words per WikiProject Films/Style guidelines, and that a spoiler warning is unnecessary per Wikipedia:Spoiler.-->
James Bond ([[Daniel Craig]]) is driving from [[Lake Como]] to [[Siena]], [[Italy]] with the captured [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] ([[Jesper Christensen]]). After evading pursuers, Bond and [[M (James Bond)|M]] ([[Judi Dench]]) interrogate White regarding his organization, [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]]. M's bodyguard, Mitchell, a [[double agent]], attacks M, enabling White to escape; Bond chases Mitchell across Siena and kills him. 

Bond and M travel search Mitchell's flat and discover he had a contact in [[Haiti]]. Bond heads to Haiti to investigate Mitchell's contact, Edmund Slate, and learns that Slate was sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] ([[Olga Kurylenko]]) at the behest of her lover, [[Dominic Greene]] ([[Mathieu Amalric]]), the chairman of an ecological organization called Greene Planet. While observing her meeting with Greene, Bond learns that Greene is helping the [[Bolivia]]n general Medrano ([[Joaquin Cosio]])&mdash;who murdered Camille's family&mdash;overthrow his government in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.

After rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Austria]]; en route, CIA agent Gregg Beam ([[David Harbour]]) strikes a non-interference deal with Greene to maintain access to Bolivian oil, overruling the objections of Felix Leiter ([[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]). Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, and a gunfight ensues in the adjoining restaurant. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard of Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is killed, and M, assuming Bond is the killer, has his passports and credit cards revoked. Bond convinces his old ally [[René Mathis]] ([[Giancarlo Giannini]]) to accompany him to [[La Paz]]. They are greeted by [[Strawberry Fields (character)|Strawberry Fields]] ([[Gemma Arterton]]), an MI6 field operative from the [[Diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom|British Consulate]], who demands that Bond return to the UK on the next available flight; nonetheless, Bond soon seduces her before they attend a party Greene holds that night.

At the party, Bond rescues Camille again from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police working for Medrano; they had earlier attacked Mathis and put him in the trunk of Bond's car to frame him, and in the ensuing struggle Mathis is killed. Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition in a [[Douglas DC-3]] plane, but are shot down by an [[Alenia Aermacchi|Aermacchi]] [[Aermacchi SF.260|SF.260]] fighter and a [[Bell Helicopter|Bell]] [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopter.  They parachute out of the burning plane into a [[sinkhole]]. In the cave, Bond and Camille discover Quantum is not after oil but is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water, normally flowing in [[subterranean river]]s, to create a monopoly. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns that Quantum murdered Fields by drowning her naked in [[crude oil]]. M orders Bond arrested for disobeying orders but he defies her and escapes. 

Bond meets Leiter, who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet at an [[eco-hotel]] in the [[Atacama Desert|Bolivian desert]] to finalize the coup; warned by Leiter, he evades American special forces attempting to kill him. At the hotel, Greene and Medrano negotiate their terms. Greene then finally reveals his true plans. By gaining control of the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Greene badgers Medrano into accepting a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water utility company at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the hotel and executes the chief of police for betraying Mathis, and then confronts Greene. The hotel is destroyed during the battle, but Camille kills Medrano, and Bond captures Greene. After interrogating him about Quantum, Bond leaves Greene stranded in the middle of the desert with only a can of [[motor oil]]. Bond and Camille kiss before they part.

Bond goes to [[Kazan]], [[Russia]], where he confronts [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira (Simon Kassianides), who is with Corrine ([[Stana Katic]]), a Canadian agent. Yusef is a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections, such as Vesper. In an act of restraint, Bond decides not to kill Yusef and allows MI6 to arrest him. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found in the middle of the desert dead, with motor oil in his stomach, but Bond denies knowing anything. M also reveals that Felix has been promoted and has taken Beam's place. She reinstates Bond as an agent; he tells M that he never left. As he leaves, he drops the necklace Yusef had given Vesper in the snow.

*[[Olga Kurylenko]] as [[Camille Montes]], a Russian-Bolivian agent with her own [[Feud|vendetta]] regarding Greene and Medrano.

*[[Mathieu Amalric]] as [[Dominic Greene]], Main villain. A leading member of Quantum posing as a businessman working in [[reforestation]] and charity funding for [[environmental science]]. Amalric acknowledged taking the role was an easy decision because, "It's impossible to say to your kids that 'I could have been in a Bond film but I refused.'"<ref name=guardian/> Amalric wanted to wear make-up for the role, but Forster explained that he wanted Greene not to look grotesque, but to symbolise the hidden evils in society.<ref name=ew/> Amalric modelled his performance on "the smile of [[Tony Blair]] [and] the craziness of [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]]," the latter of whom he called "the worst villain we [the French] have ever had [...] he walks around thinking he's in a Bond film."<ref>{{cite news | title = Mathieu Amalric to model Bond Villain on Tony Blair | work = [[thelondonpaper]] | date = 2008-01-24 | url = http://www.thelondonpaper.com/cs/Satellite/london/news/article/1157150397402?packedargs=aid%3D1157150397402%26suffix%3DArticleController | accessdate=2008-01-31}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He later claimed this was not criticism of either politician, but rather an example of how a politician relies on performance instead of a genuine policy to win power.

*[[Gemma Arterton]] as MI6 Agent [[Agent Strawberry Fields (character)#Strawberry Fields|Strawberry Fields]], who works at the British [[consulate]] in [[Bolivia]]. Fields, who is merely an office worker as described by M, takes herself seriously and tries to over-power Bond when the pair meet. She later was seduced by Bond and infiltrates Greene's fund raiser party with him and ended up paying the ultimate price. Forster found Arterton a witty actress and selected her from a reported 1,500 candidates. One of the casting directors asked her to audition for the role, having seen her portray Rosaline in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' at the [[Globe Theatre]].<ref name=dianarigg>{{cite news | author = Chris Tilly | title = Gemma Arteron Q&A | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2008-01-30 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/848/848237p1.html | accessdate=2008-01-30}}</ref> Arterton said Fields was "not so frolicsome" as other Bond girls, but is instead "fresh and young, not [...] a [[femme fatale]]."<ref name=bbctitle/> Arterton described Fields as a homage to the 1960s Bond girls, comparing her red wig to [[Diana Rigg]], who played [[Tracy Bond]] in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''. Rigg, alongside [[Honor Blackman]], is one of her favourite Bond girls.<ref name=dianarigg/> Arterton had to film her character's death scene first day on the set.

*[[Giancarlo Giannini]] as René Mathis, Bond's ally who was mistakenly believed to be a traitor in ''Casino Royale''. Having been acquitted, he chooses to aid Bond again and watches as Bond is under the strict authority of Fields.
*[[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] as [[Felix Leiter]], Bond's ally at the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. This marked the first time the same actor played Leiter twice in a row. Only [[David Hedison]] had previously played the character twice, in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973) and ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' (1989), but these performances were not consecutive.<ref name=guardian/> Early script drafts gave Leiter a larger role, but his screentime was restricted by on-set rewrites.<ref name=secret>{{cite news | title = The Secrets of Quantum of Solace | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2008-04-05 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/864/864542p1.html | accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref>
*[[Judi Dench]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]]. Forster felt Dench was underused in the previous films and wanted to make her part bigger, having her interact with Bond more because she is "the only woman Bond doesn’t see in a sexual context," which Forster finds interesting.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fostering change|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=2008-10-11|url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2008/10/11/movies/2202154&sec=movies|accessdate=2008-10-13}}</ref>

His name was chosen by Paul Haggis,<ref name=moviefone/> while Taubman chose the [[bowl cut]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Anatole Taubman On Elvis|work=[[MI6.co.uk]]|date=2008-11-07|url=http://mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/bond_22_qos_capsule_elvis.php3?t=qos&s=qos&id=02075|accessdate=2008-11-09}}</ref> Amalric and Taubman improvised a backstory for Elvis: he is Dominic's cousin and once lived on the streets before being inducted into Quantum.

*[[David Harbour]] as Gregg Beam, the CIA Section Chief for South America and a contact of Felix Leiter. 
*[[Joaquín Cosío]] as General Medrano, the exiled general whom Greene is helping to get back into power, in return for support of his organisation. He is responsible for the murder of Camille's entire family when she was a young girl.
*[[Jesper Christensen]] as [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]], whom Bond captured after he stole the money won at ''Casino Royale'' in [[Montenegro]].
*[[Rory Kinnear]] as [[Bill Tanner]], M's aide.
*[[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]].
*[[Neil Jackson]] as Edmund Slate, a henchman who fights Bond in Haiti. 
*Simon Kassianides as Yusef, who has a confrontation with Bond in [[Kazan]] towards the end of the film.
*[[Stana Katic]] as Corrine Veneau, a Canadian agent.
*Glenn Foster as Craig Mitchell, M's bodyguard and a double agent.
*[[Oona Castilla Chaplin]] as '[[damsel in distress]]' - girl saved by Kurylenko in one of last sequences.

Directors [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Alfonso Cuarón]] are friends of Marc Forster and while filming he asked them to cameo, providing voices in the Spanish language. Cuarón appears as a Bolivian helicopter pilot, while del Toro provides several other voices.<ref>{{cite news|title=Del Toro, Cuaron do voices in new Bond film|agency=Associated Press|date=2008-10-23|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hU3ob2X-IVqYjDCrXtxIbZUi8ZkAD9405TFO0|accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref>

Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up."<ref name=guardian/> He said that "Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [Vesper Lynd] has been killed,"<ref name=confuse>{{cite news |title=Daniel: the title is meant to confuse |work=[[Press and Journal (Scotland)|Press and Journal]] |date=2008-01-24}}</ref> and therefore, "[Bond is] looking for revenge [...] to make himself happy with the world again."<ref name=bbctitle/> Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in ''Casino Royale''.<ref name=quantum/> Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd.<ref name=criminal/> Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to "let me know what it feels like" when he succeeds, the implication of the title being that it will be a small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.

The film returns to the traditional [[James Bond gun barrel sequence|gun barrel opening shot]], which was altered into part of the story for ''Casino Royale'' where it was moved to the end of the title sequence. In this film the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end of the movie, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise,<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Caro|title=James Bond: 15 facts to know now|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=2008-11-09|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/arts/chi-bond-1109-covernov09,0,4869399.story|accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref> and to signify the conclusion of the story begun in the previous film. The opening credits sequence was created by [[MK12]]; Having worked on Forster's ''[[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|Stranger than Fiction]]'' and ''[[The Kite Runner (film)|The Kite Runner]]'', MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on in production, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the [[#Music|title singer]] was changed.

Fourteen cameras were used to film the [[Palio di Siena]], footage which was later edited into the main sequence. Aerial shots using helicopters were banned, and the crew were also forbidden from showing any violence "involving either people or animals."<ref name=paliodisiena/> To shoot the foot chase in [[Siena]] in April 2008 four camera cranes were built in the town, and a [[Skycam|cable camera]] was also used.<ref name=siena/> [[Framestore]] worked on the Siena chase, duplicating the 1000 extras during principal photography to match shots of the 40,000 strong audience at the real Palio, removing wires that held Craig and the stuntmen in the rooftop segment of the chase, and digital expansion of the floor and skylight in the art gallery Bond and Mitchell fall into.<ref name=vfxworld/> The art gallery fight was intended to be simple, but during filming Craig's stunt double accidentally fell from the construction scaffolding. Forster preferred the idea of Bond hanging from ropes reaching for his gun to kill Mitchell, rather than having both men run out of the building to continue their chase as specified in the script, and the number of effects shots increased.<ref name=vfxworld/>

To film the aerial dogfight, a "Snakehead" camera was built and placed on the nose and tail of a [[Piper Aerostar]] 700. [[SolidWorks]], who provided the software used to design the camera, stated "pilots for the first time can fly as aggressively as they dare without sacrificing the drama of the shot." The camera could turn 360 degrees and was shaped like a [[periscope]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Chris Reidy | title = "Snakehead" films James Bond dogfight footage | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | date = 2008-05-12 | url =  http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2008/05/_the_concord_of.html | accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> The crew also mounted SpaceCams on helicopters, and placed cameras with 1600&nbsp;mm lenses underground, to cover the action.<ref name=dogfight/> Forster wanted to film the planefight as a homage to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[North by Northwest]]'', and chose planes like the [[Douglas DC-3]] to suit that.<ref name=aicnqa>{{cite news|title=Capone talks with James Bond himself, Daniel Craig, and Quantum of Solace director Marc Forster in London!!!|work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=2008-09-21|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38427|accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = For Your Eyes Only: RT in Austria with James Bond | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date = 2008-05-09 | url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/quantum_of_solace/news/1727255/2/for_your_eyes_only_rt_in_austria_with_james_bond | accessdate=2008-05-16}}</ref> 

The [[free-fall]] scene involved its own set of challenges, Craig disliked the idea of "being hung by wires and blown by a large fan in front of a green screen" but actual [[sky diving]] coverage has serious drawbacks. It’s not only difficult, dangerous and time-consuming, but nearly always results in problematic head-replacements for close-ups. Stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell and VFX Designer Kevin Tod Haug, presented the idea of filming the scene in a large [[vertical wind tunnel]] in [[Bedford]] in order to do this sequence as practically as possible.  
While a great solution for the actors’ performances the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert, and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight [[Dalsa Origin]] cameras (supported by 7 HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was used to create a [[virtual camera]] with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]<ref name=fxguide/> developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.   
During the shooting in the wind tunnel Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact lenses that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, they only shot for thirty seconds at a time.<ref name=ugoqa>{{cite news|url=http://movieblog.ugo.com/index.php/movieblog/more/your_quantum_of_solace_questions_answered/|title=Your Quantum of Solace Questions Answered!|work=[[UGO Networks]]|date=2008-09-21|accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref> Forster wished he had more time to work on the free-fall scene.<ref name=vfxworld/>

The [[Moving Picture Company]] created the climactic hotel sequence.

[[David Arnold]], who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, returned for ''Quantum of Solace''. He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on ''Casino Royale'', the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to "really work it out."

Though there was no [[novelization|novelisation]] despite its original storyline, [[Penguin Books]] published a compilation of Fleming's short stories entitled ''[[Quantum of Solace (short story collection)|Quantum of Solace: The Complete James Bond Short Stories]]'', with a UK release date of 29 May 2008<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0141189622 Amazon.co.uk listing].

The November/December 2008 issue of [[Cigar Aficionado]] was a special James Bond edition written by [[David Giammarco]], noted author of [[For Your Eyes Only: Behind the Scenes of the James Bond Films]], and featured an extensive 20-page feature on the making of ''Quantum of Solace'' from his exclusive interviews on location with Daniel Craig, Gemma Arterton, Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, director Marc Forster, and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. This tribute issue of the upscale magazine also featured Giammarco's in-depth profile of 007 author Ian Fleming and the 46-year history of the James Bond films. The ''[[Cigar Aficionado]]'' James Bond special edition became the magazine's biggest-selling issue around the world.

Reviews for ''Quantum of Solace'' have been mixed. Of the 241 reviews listed on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 63% are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10. However, only 36% of selected notable reviewers gave it a positive write-up, with an average rating of 5.6/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Quantum of Solace''|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/quantum_of_solace/|accessdate=2008-10-25}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] calculated a score of 58 out of 100 from 38 reviews, indicating a "mixed or average" response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/quantumofsolace|title=Quantum of Solace|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref> Critics generally preferred ''Casino Royale'', but continued to praise Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series. The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the serious and gritty feel that the film carried over.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tom Butler|title=UK Tomatometer Preview: Quantum Of Solace - Is the New Bond Shaken or Stirred?|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=2008-10-31|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/quantum_of_solace/news/1777726/uk_tomatometer_preview_quantum_of_solace_is_the_new_bond_shaken_or_stirred|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref> 

[[Roger Moore]], the third actor to play Bond in the films, continued to feel Craig was a "damn good Bond but the film as a whole, there was a bit too much flash cutting [and] it was just like a commercial of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on."<ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Roger Moore weighs in on `Quantum of Solace`|work=[[MI6.co.uk]]|date=2009-03-16|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=7432&t=mi6&s=news|accessdate=2009-03-17}}</ref> 

[[Kim Newman]] of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' gave it 4/5, remarking it was not "bigger and better than ''Casino Royale'', [which is] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond’s mission has barely begun." However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Kim Newman]]|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134523|title=''Quantum of Solace'' (12A)|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire Online]]|accessdate=2008-10-22}}</ref> ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' review noted that "[f]ollowing ''Casino Royale'' was never going to be easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand’s successful relaunch crashing back to earth — with a yawn"; the screenplay "is at times incomprehensible" and the casting "is a mess." The review concludes that "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get [[product placement]]; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Cosmo Landesman]]|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article5001623.ece|title=Quantum of Solace - The Sunday Times review|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=2008-10-26|accessdate=2008-10-28 | location=London}}</ref> 

''[[The Guardian]]'' gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars,<!--more than the Sunday Times that is--> and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he 
"made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" and calling the film "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes "''Quantum of Solace'' isn't as good as ''Casino Royale'': the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Peter Bradshaw]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/18/jamesbond1|title=Quantum of Solace|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2008-10-18|accessdate=2008-10-28 | location=London}}</ref>

''[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]'' says "Notices will focus - rightly - on Craig's magnetism as the steely, sexy, murderous MI6 agent, but two other factors weigh in and freshen up proceedings: Forster's new technical team, led by cinematographer Roberto Schaefer and production designer Dennis Gassner. And the ongoing shift of M, as played by Judi Dench, to front and centre: the Bond girls fade into insignificance as she becomes his moral counterpoint and theirs is the only real relationship on screen." The review continues, "Bond is, as has been previously noted, practically the [[Martin Scorsese]] of the [[BAFTA]]s: 22 films later, with grosses probably close to the [[GDP]] of one of the small nations it depicts, it's still waiting for that [[Alexander Korda]] award. The best ''Casino Royale'' could achieve was a gong for sound. Will this be the year that changes its fortunes?"<ref>{{cite web|title=Fionnuala Halligan|title=Quantum of Solace|work=Screen Daily|date=2008-10-20|url=http://www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=41477|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'', who praised the previous film, disliked ''Quantum of Solace''. He wrote that the plot was mediocre, characters weak and that Bond lacked his usual personality, despite his praise for Craig's interpretation of the role. Throughout his review, he emphasised that "James Bond is not an action hero," and also criticised the lack of a fantastical villainous lair and the Bond girls' names not being [[double entendres]].<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081111/REVIEWS/811129989 Review] by Roger Ebert, November 12, 2008</ref>
Some writers criticised the choice of ''Quantum of Solace'' as a title. "Yes, it's a bad title," wrote Marni Weisz, the editor of ''Famous'', a [[Canada|Canadian]] film publication distributed in movie theatres in that country, in an editorial entitled "At least it's not ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]''."<ref>Marni Weisz, "At least it's not Octopussy," ''Famous'', October 2008, p. 6</ref>

'''''Sister Act''''' is a 1992 [[United States|American]] [[comedy film]] released by [[Touchstone Pictures]]. Directed by [[Emile Ardolino]], it features musical arrangements by [[Marc Shaiman]] and stars [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as a [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] lounge singer who has been put under [[protective custody]] in a [[San Francisco]] [[convent]] and has to pretend to be a [[nun]] when a mob boss puts her on his hit list. Also in the cast are [[Maggie Smith]], [[Kathy Najimy]], [[Wendy Makkena]], [[Mary Wickes]], and [[Harvey Keitel]]. The film is #83 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''The 100 Funniest Movies'' list.

The film was followed by a 1993 sequel, ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]''. It also inspired [[Sister Act (musical)|a musical stage version]] that premiered at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in [[Pasadena, California]] in 2006, and opened at the [[London Palladium]] with previews from May 7, 2009.

==Plot==
The movie opens at a Catholic elementary school in 1968. There, a strict nun scolds a little girl named Deloris for giving sarcastic answers in class. The nun warns the girl that she will be doomed to a life of sin if she does not mend her ways.

In the present day, Deloris van Cartier ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]) is a lounge singer at a casino in [[Reno, Nevada]]. She is involved in a relationship with a married man, mobster Vincent "Vince" LaRocca ([[Harvey Keitel]]). Deloris is oblivious to his criminal activities, as he always keeps her out of his "business". After a fight, Vince tries to win Deloris' affection back with a beautiful purple mink coat, but she discovers that the coat belongs to Vince's wife. Furious, she decides to break up with Vince that night. She heads for Vince's office in the casino where she works, to return the coat and tell Vince she's leaving him. Meanwhile, Vince is in the office confronting his limo driver, whom he accuses of being a police informant. When Deloris walks in, she hears a shot and sees the limo driver dead on the floor. Vince's thugs, Willy ([[Richard Portnow]]) and Joey (Robert Miranda), are also present. They chase Deloris, but she escapes through the basement of the casino and disappears into the street, whereupon she takes a cab to the police station. Lieutenant Eddie Souther ([[Bill Nunn]]) hears her story and implores her to testify against Vince. Knowing her life will be in danger, she reluctantly agrees. To protect her, Lt. Souther arranges for Deloris to hide out in the last place Vince would look for her - a convent. She is to stay there until the trial, which is at least two months off.

Deloris goes into hiding at St. Catherine's, a Roman Catholic convent in a seedy, crime-ridden neighborhood of [[San Francisco]]. The convent is attached to a church that is in disrepair and poorly attended. Only the Reverend Mother knows her real identity, and her reason for being there. She is required to wear a nun's habit, and is given the name "Sister Mary Clarence". Her lounge singer attitudes quickly alienate the Reverend Mother ([[Maggie Smith]]), who is only pacified by the promise of funds for the impoverished convent. Deloris chafes at the spartan lifestyle of a nun. When she complains, the Reverend Mother points out the flaws in Deloris' life, insisting that God brought her to the convent for a reason. After this lecture, Deloris begins to make friends with the other sisters, particularly Sister Mary Patrick ([[Kathy Najimy]]), an eternally sunny individual, Sister Mary Lazarus ([[Mary Wickes]]), a decidedly old-fashioned nun, and young Sister Mary Robert ([[Wendy Makkena]]), a [[postulant]] who seeks meaning in her life.

When Deloris hears the convent's choir, which is horribly lackluster and off-key, at Sunday Mass, she breaks. She calls Lt. Souther and begs him to find another safe-house for her. He informs her that someone in the police department is leaking information about witnesses, so moving her would be risky, and she must stay where she is. That night, Deloris sneaks out of the convent to visit the biker bar across the street, and Sisters Mary Patrick and Mary Robert follow her. When they return, an angry Reverend Mother is prepared to have Deloris kicked out, but she begs for forgiveness. Reverend Mother relents, on the condition that Deloris joins the choir.

Deloris goes to choir practice, and finds that the group is terrible. Having heard that Deloris has a background in music, Sister Mary Patrick suggests that she should teach them. Urged on by the choir members, Mary Lazarus, the choir mistress, grudgingly agrees. Deloris reminds the sisters that they must feel what they sing, as it is a form of rejoicing. She also discovers that Sister Mary Robert has a powerful voice, hidden by shyness. Under Deloris' tutelage, the choir is transformed. At the next Sunday Mass, they begin with a beautiful rendition of "Hail, Holy Queen", and the Reverend Mother is visibly pleased. Then, suddenly, the song becomes soulful and syncopated - a fusion of [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[rock and Roll Music]]. People in the street outside are intrigued, and find their way into the nearly-empty church.

Reverend Mother is furious at Deloris' attempts to restyle the music. But the priest of the church, Monsignor O'Hara ([[Joseph Maher]]), loves the new arrangements, and praises the [[Abbess]] for her innovation. Deloris craftily mentions that Reverend Mother wants the nuns to perform community service in the neighborhood, something she has opposed for safety reasons. The sisters eagerly take to the streets, where they clean and paint, run a soup kitchen, and create a playground for inner-city children. All the while, Deloris teaches them new songs, including [[Mary Wells]]' "[[My Guy]]" as "My God". Church attendance and financial support skyrocket. The nuns even find themselves on the local news, which is not a good thing for Deloris, who is supposed to be invisible. Capping off their success, Monsignor O'Hara announces that [[Pope John Paul II]] plans to stop by the church for a special concert, during the upcoming Papal visit to San Francisco.

Unfortunately for Deloris, the "leak" in the police department, Detective Tate, notices that Lt. Souther has made donations to the church. Realizing that Deloris must be hiding there, he calls Vince with the news. Lt. Souther discovers his betrayal and has him arrested. Since the cat is out of the bag, he immediately flies to San Francisco to tell Deloris what has happened and, hopefully, to protect her. He finds her unharmed, though fails to bring her in his custody; chance for Vince's suddenly emerging goons to kidnap Deloris and Sister Mary Robert. After Deloris helps the young nun to escape, Mary Robert returns to the convent and tells them of Vince's plan to take Deloris back to Reno. the Reverend Mother reveals that Deloris was not really a nun but a witness in protective custody. Despite their not always getting along, Deloris's friends convince Reverend Mother to help her, and they guilt-trip a helicopter pilot into flying them to Reno.

Deloris, still in her habit but tied up, remains calm and prays for guidance while the nuns dash about the casino, searching for her. Vince's underlings cannot bring themselves to kill Deloris while she wears a habit, and she manages to escape when they untie her to remove the garb. She meets up with the sisters, but as they all head for the exit, Vince and his henchmen find and corner them. Vince orders his men to shoot Deloris, but they still can't bring themselves to kill a nun. Vince angrily sneers that Deloris is "just a broad", and far from being a nun. Reverend Mother passionately defends her, claiming that she has all the qualities of a true nun. The delay proves just long enough for Lt. Souther to shoot Vince through a window before Vince can shoot Deloris. The police arrest the wounded Vince and his associates. As they are led away, Deloris' last "two words" to Vince are, unexpectedly, "bless you". 

The Reverend Mother is emotionally moved at this revelation of character shown by Delores as they both turn to regail their adventure.

Before Deloris returns to her singing career, she leads the nuns in a rendition of "[[I Will Follow Him]]" for the Pope. Sister Mary Robert finally realizes her true potential and sings a solo during the song, and the Pope himself happily claps to the beat. The film ends with the Pope and church patrons giving the choir a standing ovation. The final shot of Deloris at the altar turns into a magazine cover telling her story, headlined "Heaven Helped Me", leading off a montage of covers, and it's revealed that Deloris starts a recording career with "Listen, Sister!", a [[rock and roll]] record, and "Gonna Make You Pray", a [[gospel]] album.

'''''Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit''''' is a [[1993 in film|1993]] [[comedy film]] starring [[Whoopi Goldberg]]. Directed by [[Bill Duke]], and released by [[Touchstone Pictures]], it is the [[sequel]] to the successful 1992 film ''[[Sister Act]]''. Most of the original cast reprise their roles in the sequel, including [[Maggie Smith]], [[Kathy Najimy]], [[Wendy Makkena]], and [[Mary Wickes]]. 

==Plot==
Sister Mary Patrick ([[Kathy Najimy]]), Sr. Mary Robert ([[Wendy Makkena]]) and Sr. Mary Lazarus ([[Mary Wickes]]) visit Deloris ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]), now starring in a final performance Las Vegas musical about her misadventures in the convent. After the show, the three sisters ask her for help. The sisters are now in the service of St. Francis Academy, a high school Deloris had attended herself, that is run by the diocese and is in danger of closing down. Despite the best efforts of the sisters and staff, the school's administrator, Mr. Crisp ([[James Coburn]]) is working to convince the diocese to close the school, thinking it has better use as a parking lot.  The kids aren't much better, disrespectful and argumentative, and they get so bad, that, according to dialogue, Sister Mary Patrick is driven to frown, twice.  

Deloris initially declines their request, but changes her mind when she hears that Mother Superior ([[Maggie Smith]]) is in a desperate situation. Upon their arrival at St. Francis Academy, Mother Superior asks her to teach music to a class of teenagers who are actually rebellious. At first, the students play tricks on her, hoping to drive her away.  Eventually, they realize that, not only is she more powerful and determined than they are, but she also has something to offer them.  Slowly, the entire class, except Rita Watson, eventually grow to like her. During the course of the school year, Deloris{{ndash}}as Sister Mary Clarence{{ndash}}discovers their singing talent and decides to organize them into a choir.  Nobody but the sisters believes that they can actually pull this off, partly because of the students' lackluster attitude, until one of the students, an overly-talkative expert on African history with a remarkably mousy voice, hits a beautiful high note during "Oh, happy day" that surprises even Deloris.

Deloris obtains use of the school's old music room. As the other sisters help clean it up, they discover old trophies and ribbons the school won from the All-State Music Competition from decades before. They find out the competition still takes place in Hollywood, and they convince Deloris and the students to enter, in the hopes they can save St. Francis from closing if they win. Upon raising the funds for the trip, the choir prepares.  

Meanwhile, Rita Watson ([[Lauryn Hill]]), one of the rebellious students, is discovering her talent as a singer, much to the dismay of her single parent mother ([[Sheryl Lee Ralph]]). Mrs. Watson tries to convince her daughter that there is no future in singing. Rita refuses to go along with Delores' changes to the class, and leaves it for several days.  However, she returns, insistant on her dreams of making as a singer, despite her mother's total opposition.  Faking her mother's consent, Rita goes with the choir to the competition. Finding a note, her mother realizes what Rita has done, and desperately drives to Hollywood to bring her home.  When she gets there, though, Mrs. Watson listens to her daughter sing and discovers that she was wrong; Rita ''does'' have the talent necessary to make it as a musician and be successful, and she is proud of her daughter's performance.  

As the group heads to the competition, the school board discovers that Deloris is actually a Las Vegas showgirl. The board heads after them to withdraw the choir from the competition. The school's principal, Father Maurice ([[Barnard Hughes]]), is greeted by the students who think that he came to support them. Touched by their appreciation and glowing faces, he decides not to withdraw the choir, against the wishes of Mr. Crisp. After Father Ignatius ([[Michael Jeter]]), Father Wolfgang ([[Thomas Gottschalk]]) and Father Thomas ([[Brad Sullivan]]) trap Crisp in a storage closet, held closed by the cook's famous frozen sausage, they all then race to watch the choir perform.  The choir then sings "Joyful, Joyful" in the competition and defeats the previous year champions, thereby saving St. Francis from closure. Mr. Crisp is transferred, with the aide of the Mother Superior, to another place in the archdiocese. Afterward, the choir learns of Deloris's true identity, to which she tells them all, ''"I am not now, nor have I ever been a Las Vegas showgirl...I am a '''headliner!'''"''.  

During the credits, the majority of the cast sings "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" together.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Although not as successful as ''[[Sister Act]]'', it still grossed [[United States dollar|$]]60 million in the [[United States]] and nearly $100 million worldwide. The movie also attracted a much younger audience towards [[Gospel music]], as well as helping to boost [[Lauryn Hill]]'s music career.
