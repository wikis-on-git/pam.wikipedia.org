The '''Kingdom of Spain''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Galician]]: ''Reino de España''; [[Catalan]]: ''Regne d'Espanya''; [[Basque]]: ''Espainiako Erresuma''; [[Occitan]]: ''Regne d'Espanha'') is the larger of the two countries that make up the Iberian peninsula—the other is [[Portugal]]—located in southwestern Europe. To the west (and, in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], south), it borders [[Portugal]]. To the south, it borders [[Gibraltar]] and, through its cities in North Africa ([[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]), [[Morocco]]. To the northeast, along the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, it borders [[France]] and the tiny [[principality]] of [[Andorra]]. It also includes the [[Balearic Islands]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Canary Islands]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and a number of uninhabited islands on the Mediterranean side of the [[strait of Gibraltar]], known as ''[[Plazas de soberanía]]'', such as the [[Islas Chafarinas|Chafarine]] islands, the "rocks" (''peñones'') of [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera|Vélez]] and [[Peñón de Alhucemas|Alhucemas]], and the tiny [[Isla Perejil]] ([[Disputed territories|disputed]]). In the Northeast along the [[Pyrenees]], a small [[exclave]] town called [[Llívia]] in [[Catalonia]] is surrounded by [[France|French]] territory.

==History==
{{main|History of Spain}}

===Prehistory===
The [[indigenous peoples]] peoples  of the [[Iberian peninsula]], consisting of a number of separate tribes, are given the generic name of [[Iberians]]. This may have included the [[Basque people|Basque]]s, as one of the pre-Celtic people. The most important culture of this period is that of the city of [[Tartessos]]. Beginning in the [[9th century BC]], [[Celt]]ic tribes entered the [[Iberian peninsula]] through the Pyrenees and settled throughout the peninsula, becoming the [[Celtiberian]]s.

The seafaring [[Phoenicians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Carthaginians]] successively settled along the Mediterranean coast and founded trading colonies there over a period of several centuries.

Around 1100 BCE, Phoenician merchants founded the trading colony of [[Gadir]] or Gades (modern day [[Cádiz]]) near Tartessos. In the 8th century BC the first Greek colonies, such as Emporion (modern [[Empúries]]), were founded along the Mediterranean coast on the East, leaving the south coast to the Phoenicians. The Greeks are responsible for the name Iberia, after the river Iber ([[Ebro]] in Spanish). In the 6th century BC the [[Carthaginians]] arrived in Iberia while struggling with the Greeks for control of the Western Mediterranean. Their most important colony was [[Carthago Nova]] (Latin name of modern day [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]).

===From the Renaissance to the 19th Century===
Until the late of the 15th century, Castile and Léon, Aragon and Navarre were independent states, with independent languages, monarchs, armies and, in the case of Aragon and Castile, two empires: the former with one in the Mediterranean and the latter with a new, rapidly growing, one in the Americas. The process of political unification continued into the early sixteenth century. It was the unification of these separate Iberian empires that became the base of what is now referred to as the [[Spanish Empire]].
[[Image:Habsburg Map 1547.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A map of the dominion of the Habsburgs following the [[Battle of Mühlberg]] (1547) as depicted in ''The Cambridge Modern History Atlas'' (1912); Habsburg lands are shaded green. From 1556 the lands in a line from the Netherlands, through to the east of France, to the south of Italy, Sardinia, and Sicily were retained by the Spanish Habsburgs.]]

By 1512, most of the kingdoms of present-day Spain were politically unified by the crown, although not as a modern, centralized state (in contemporary minds, "''Spain''" was a geographic term meaning [[Iberian Peninsula]], which includes Portugal, not the present-day ''[[state]]'' called Spain - its use, then, comparable to the use of the term "Britain"). The grandson of Isabella and Ferdinand, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] but called in Spain Carlos I, extended his crown to other places in [[Europe]] and the rest of the world. The unification of Iberia was complete when Charles V's son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], became King of [[Portugal]] in 1580, as well as of the other Iberian states (collectively known as "Spain" at that time).

During the 16th century, early [[Habsburg Spain]], in the reigns of Charles V and Philip II, Spain became the most powerful state in Europe. The Spanish Empire covered most territories of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], [[Mexico]], some of [[Asia - Pacific|Eastern Asia]] (including [[The Philippines]]), the Iberian peninsula (including the [[Portuguese empire]] from 1580), southern [[Italy]], [[Sicily]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]]. It was the first empire about which it was said that [[The empire on which the sun never sets|the sun did not set]]. It was a time of daring explorations by sea and by land, the opening up of new trade routes across oceans, conquests and the beginning of European colonization. Not only did this lead to the arrival of ever increasing quantities of precious metals, spices and luxuries, and new agricultural plants, that had a great influence on the development of Europe, but the explorers, soldiers, traders and missionaries also brought back with them a flood of knowledge that radically transformed the European understanding of the world, ending conceptions inherited from medieval times.  This [[Renaissance]] intellectual transformation is best seen in the influential [[School of Salamanca]].

The [[treasure fleet]] across the Atlantic and the [[Manila galleons]] across the Pacific made it the wealthiest and most powerful nation in Europe, but the rapidly rising influx of silver and gold from the colonies in the Americas throughout the 16th century ultimately resulted in economically damaging rampant [[inflation]] and led to [[economic depression]] by the 17th century. Religious and dynastic wars supported by the Spanish crown, especially in the Netherlands, also greatly burdened the empire's economy.

[[Image:Philip IV of Spain.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]]]
In 1640, under [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], the centralist policy of the [[Count-Duke of Olivares]] provoked wars in [[Portugal]] and [[Catalonia]]. Portugal became an independent kingdom again, taking with it its [[empire]], and Catalonia enjoyed some years of French-supported independence but was quickly returned to the Spanish Crown, except [[Roussillon]].

A series of long and costly wars and revolts followed in the early 17th century, and began a steady decline of Spanish power in Europe from the 1640s. Controversy over succession to the throne consumed the country and much of Europe during the first years of the 18th century. {{see|War of the Spanish Succession}}
It was only after this war ended and a new dynasty&mdash;the [[House of Bourbon|French Bourbons]]&mdash;was installed that a true ''Spanish'' state was established when the absolutist first Bourbon king [[Philip V of Spain]] in 1707 dissolved the parliamentarist Aragon court and unified the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon into a single, unified Kingdom of Spain, abolishing many of the regional privileges and autonomies ([[fueros]]) that had hampered Habsburg rule. The British abandoned the conflict after [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Utrecht (1713)]], which led to Barcelona's easy defeat by the absolutists in 1714. The [[National Day of Catalonia]] still commemorates this defeat.

Of note during the 17th century was the cultural efflorescence now known as the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. Spain had vast colonies in the Americas, stretching from [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]] to [[Central America]] and [[Mexico]], to some states in the present-day [[United States]]. These included all of [[Florida]], [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Texas]], and parts of [[Oklahoma]], [[Colorado]] and [[Wyoming]]. The influence of Spain on these cities is still evident in such cities as [[Los Angeles, California]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], and [[San Antonio, Texas]], as well as the [[Spanish language]]'s dominance in these states (it is interesting to note that in New Mexico, Spanish is one of the official languages, along with [[English language|English]].)

Historically the period of the mid 17th century to the mid 20th century was a relative failure for Spain compared to north western Europe. The extended, lingering, decline of the [[Spanish empire]] was due in large part, ironically, to its spectacular successes in the 15th and 16th centuries that led to the centuries of the treasure fleets bringing back silver and gold from the American mines. These shipments engendered [[Price revolution|inflation]] that ate away at Spanish trades and commerce (never very large or sophisticated, with some exceptions like ship building), eventually making the country almost totally dependant upon imports by the mid 17th century.  This proved disastrous as the silver mines became exhausted.  Worsening matters were the constant wars defending the [[global empire]] against envious European rivals, internal successions and the European wars ([[Eighty Years 'War]] and [[Thirty Years' War]]). These wars constantly drained resources in defending the [[Spanish Habsburgs|Habsburg's]] dynastic and religious interests, including the [[Counter Reformation]]. During the Thirty Years War the government sought to meet its needs by tampering with the silver content of the currency, leading to severe bouts of inflation and [[deflation]]. The burden of taxes and financial instability led to the collapse of the Castilian economy that by 1627 Castilians resorted to bartering. A severe decline in food production ensued. A steep economic and demographic decline followed, especially in empire's overburdened lynchpin, Castile, aggravated by failed harvests and plagues. Large numbers emigrated to escape the worsening conditions. Habsburg policies that had entrenched the privileges and exemptions of the nobility from the time of the [[Castilian War of the Communities]] of 1518-1520, and the vast grants of land to the Church, also played an important part in eventually undermining the economy and the curtailing of the spread of modern thought. This was in stark contrast to the diminishing status of both institutions in rivals France, England and the Netherlands. The resentment of ordinary peasants and labourers would find expression in implicating the nobility of Moorish ancestry and the churchmen of hypocrisy and found its way into the theatre and literature. The beggary that grew rapidly from the late 16th century forced many to live by their wits and inspired the popular [[picaresque]] genre of literature. This demographic, economic and political decline during the late 17th and early 18th centuries mirrored in general other regions of southern Europe such as Portugal, the Italian states, the Balkans, and much of central Europe, as the rapidly growing global oceanic trade, pioneered by the Iberian countries, was increasingly diverted to north-western Europe.

[[Image:Philip V 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], First Bourbon [[King of Spain]]]]
Following the wars of Spanish succession at its commencement, the 18th century saw a long, slow  recovery, with an expansion of the iron and steel industries in the Basque Country, a growth in ship building, some increase in trade and a recovery in food production and a slow recovery in through natural population growth. The new [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy drew on the French system in trying to [[modern|modernise]] the administration and economy, in which it was more successful in the former than the latter. In the last two decades of the century, with the ending of [[Andalucia|Andalucia's]] royally granted monopoly, trade experienced an extraordinary growth (from a relatively low base) which even witnessed the beginnings of an industrialisation of the textile industry in Catalonia. Spain's effective military assistance to the rebellious British colonies in the [[American Revolutionary War#Gulf Coast|American War of Independence]] won it renewed international status. But this promising late eighteenth century resurgence was short-lived, being totally disrupted by the turmoil of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the beginning of the [[19th century]]. This initiated a period of turmoil that led to the loss of the vast mainland American territories and plunged the country into endemic political instability, which lasted until 1939. The Napoleonic incursion led to a fierce guerilla war ([[Peninsular War]]) which saw the first wide spread manifestation of Spanish [[nationalism]]. In the 19th century, the [[Black Legend#Romantic travellers|Romantic travellers]] saw in a backward Spain an exotic country, based on [[Romanticism|romantic]] 19th century mythmaking that was confirmed by the instability of the times. In the latter half of the 19th century Spanish Catalonia became the main centre of Spain's [[industrialization]]. Pockets of relative modernity would appear, especially in Catalonia, Valencia and the Basque country, but generally Spain's political instability made progress slow and extraordinarily uneven.

At the end of the 19th century, Spain lost all of its remaining old colonies in the [[Caribbean]] and [[Asia-Pacific]] regions, including [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Philippines]], and a large number of Pacific islands to the [[United States]] after the [[Spanish-American War]] of 1898. {{seealso|Battle of Guam (1898)}}

The "Disaster" of 1898, as Spanish-American War was called, led to Spain's cultural revival ([[Generation of '98]]) in which there was much critical self examination, and relieved it from the burden of its last major colonies. However political stability in such a dispersed and variegated land, caught between pockets of modernity and large areas of extreme rural backwardness and strongly differentiated regional identities would elude the country for some decades yet, and was ultimately imposed only by a brutal dictatorship in 1939.

===20th century===
[[Image:1francisco-franco.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Francisco Franco]]

The 20th century initially brought little peace; Spain made a late and minor entry into the [[scramble for Africa]], with the colonization of [[Western Sahara]], [[Spanish Morocco]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]].  A [[Disaster of Annual|military disaster]] in Morocco in 1921 contributed to discrediting the monarch and worsened political instability. A period of dictatorial rule (1923 - 1931) ended with the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. The Republic offered political autonomy to the [[Basque Country]], [[Catalonia]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (where the autonomy did not have any effect due to the civil war) and gave voting rights to women. However, in July 1936, against a backdrop of increasing political polarization, [[anti-clericalism]] and pressure from all sides, coupled with growing and unchecked political violence, the Republic was faced with an attempted military coup d'etat led by right-wing army generals. Although the coup initially failed, the ensuing [[Spanish Civil War]] ended in 1939 with the victory of the [[nationalist]] forces led by the ruthlessly efficient General [[Francisco Franco]] and supported by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[fascist Italy]]. The Republican side received tepid support from European democracies, which left the [[USSR|Soviet Union]] and idealist voluntary [[International Brigades]] as the only supporters of the legitimate democratic Republican rule. The Spanish Civil War has been called the first battle of the [[Second World War]]. After the civil war, General Francisco Franco ruled a nation exhausted politically and economically. Guerilla warfare in the countryside continued until 1950. During the Second World War, Franco, under extreme pressure (Hitler had brought his army to the border of Spain after invading France), opted to remain neutral arguing that Spain could not afford a new war, but, as a concession to his civil war backer, authorised volunteers to go to the Russian front to fight the Soviet Union in an anti-Communist crusade in what came to be known as the [[Blue Division]]. On the other hand tens of thousands of Spanish refugees in France, many of them experienced anti-fascist soldiers and guerilla fighters, played a leading role in the French resistance. [http://www.libcom.org/history/articles/spanish-resistance-in-france-1939/] The resentment of Franco's brutality towards the more modern pro-Republican regions of Catalonia and the Basque country, whose distinctive languages and identities he suppressed during his long reign, continues to fuel strong separatist movements to this day. 

The only official party in Spain at the time of Franco’s regime was the [[Falange]] party founded by [[Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera]]. Primo de Rivera denied his party was [[fascist]], calling fascism fundamentally false. His political philosophy was based on Catholicism, saying that man "carries eternal values" and carries "a soul that is capable of damning or saving itself". He called for "the greatest respect for... human dignity, for the integrity of man and for his liberty." Primo de Rivera called for what he called "organic democracy".  Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera was executed in [[Alicante]] in 1936.

After [[World War II]], being one of few surviving fascist regimes in Europe, Spain was politically and economically isolated and was kept out of the [[United Nations]] until 1955, when it became strategically important for U.S. president [[Eisenhower]] to establish a military presence in the Iberian peninsula. This opening to Spain was aided by Franco's opposition to communism. In the 1960s, more than a decade later than other western European countries, Spain began to enjoy economic growth ([[Spanish miracle]]) which gradually transformed it into a modern [[industry|industrial]] economy with a thriving [[tourism]] sector. Growth continued well into the 1970s, with Franco's government going to great lengths to shield the Spanish people from the effects of the [[oil crisis]].

Upon the death of the [[dictator]] General Franco in November 1975, his personally-designated heir [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Prince Juan Carlos]] assumed the position of king and [[head of state]]. With the approval of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] and the arrival of [[democracy]], some regions &mdash; Basque Country, [[Navarra]]&mdash; were given complete financial autonomy, and many &mdash; Basque Country, Catalonia, [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Andalusia]]&mdash; were given some [[Autonomous Communities of Spain|political autonomy]], which was then soon extended to all Spanish regions, resulting in a quite decentralized territorial organization in [[Western Europe]]. Remaining dysfunctions, such as unlimited financial strain on contributor regions such as Catalonia make their people aim for a more equilibrated system, such as those enjoyed in Germany, where financial contribution to the whole can never exceed 4% of a Land's GDP. In the Basque Country moderate Basque [[nationalism|nationalisms]] coexist with radical nationalism supportive of the [[terrorism|terrorist]] group [[ETA]], which remains one of the biggest problems faced by Spanish citizens.
[[Image:ac.madrid2.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The scene of one of the Madrid bombings.]]

[[Adolfo Suárez|Adolfo Suárez González]], [[Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo Bustelo]], after an attempted [[coup d'état]] in 1981, [[Felipe González|Felipe González Márquez]] (when Spain joined [[NATO]] and [[European Union]]), [[José María Aznar|José María Aznar López]] and [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] have been presidents of the government of Spain.

===21st century===
On March 11, 2004, a series of bombs exploded in commuter trains in Madrid, Spain. These resulted in 192 people dead and 1,460 wounded. It also had a significant effect on the upcoming elections in Spain, due in part to the ruling government's insistence that the ETA was the prime suspect in the bombings, even as the evidence of Muslim extremist terrorism rapidly emerged from the police investigation and the international press. {{see|11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings}}

==Politics==
[[Image:KingJuanCarlosI.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I]] [[King of Spain|of Spain]].]]
{{main|Politics of Spain}}
Spain is a [[constitutional monarchy]], with a hereditary [[monarch]] and a bicameral [[parliament]], the ''[[Cortes Generales]]'' or National Assembly. The [[executive branch]] consists of a Council of Ministers presided over by the President of Government (comparable to a [[prime minister]]), proposed by the monarch and elected by the National Assembly following legislative elections.

The [[legislative branch]] is made up of the Congress of Deputies (''Congreso de los Diputados'') with 350 members, elected by popular vote on block lists by proportional representation to serve four-year terms, and a [[Senate]] or ''Senado'' with 259 seats of which 208 are directly elected by popular vote and the other 51 appointed by the regional legislatures to also serve four-year terms.

Spain is, at present, what is called a ''[[State]] of Autonomies'', formally unitary but, in fact, functioning as a [[Federation]] of [[Autonomous Communities of Spain|Autonomous Communities]], each one with different powers (for instance, some have their own educational and health systems, others do not) and laws. There are some differences within this system, since power has been devolved from the centre to the periphery asymmetrically, with some autonomous governments (especially those dominated by nationalist parties) seeking a more federalist&mdash;or even [[confederation|confederate]]&mdash;kind of relationship with Spain, now the Central Government is dealing with autonomous governments for the transfer of more autonomy. This novel system of asymmetrical [[devolution]] has been described as a [[coconstitutionalism]] and has similarities to the devolution process adopted by the [[United Kingdom]] since 1997.
[[Image:PsoeZapatero.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], [[Prime Minister of Spain]].]]
The terrorist group, [[ETA]] (Basque Homeland and Freedom), is attempting to achieve Basque independence through [[violence|violent]] means, including bombings and killings of politicians, police and militaries. They consider themselves a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] organization. Although the Basque Autonomous government does not condone any kind of violence, their different approaches to the separatist movement are a source of tension between the federal and Basque governments.

On [[17 May]] [[2005]], all the parties in the Congress of Deputies, except the PP, passed the Central Government's motion of beginning peace talks with the ETA with no political concessions and only if it gives up all its weapons. PSOE, CiU, ERC, PNV, IU-ICV, CC and the mixed group -BNG, CHA, EA y NB- supported it with a total of 192 votes, while the 147 PP parliamentaris objected.

On February 20th 2005, Spain became the first country to allow its people to vote on the European Union constitution that was signed in October 2004. The rules state that if any country rejects the constitution then the constitution will be declared void. Despite a very low participation (42%), the final result was very strongly in affirmation of the constitution, making Spain the first country to approve the constitution via [[referendum]] ([[Hungary]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Slovenia]] approved it before Spain, but they did not hold referenda).

On July 1st 2005, Spain became the fourth country in the world to allow gay marriages.

==Administrative divisions==
Administratively, Spain is divided into 50 [[provinces of Spain|provinces]], grouped into 17 [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] and 2 autonomous cities with high degree of autonomy.

===Autonomous communities===
[[Image:ccaa-spain.png|thumb|400px|Autonomous communities of Spain]]
{{main|Autonomous communities of Spain}}
Spain consists of 17 autonomous communities (''comunidades autónomas'') and 2 autonomous cities (''ciudades autónomas''; [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]).
* [[Andalusia]] (''Andalucía'')
* [[Aragon]] (''Aragón'')
* [[Asturias|Principality of Asturias]] (''Principáu d'Asturies'' in [[Asturian language|Asturian]]/''Principado de Asturias'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])
* [[Balearic Islands]] (''Illes Balears'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] / ''Islas Baleares'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])
* [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (''Euskadi'' in [[Basque language|Basque]]/''País Vasco'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])
* [[Canary Islands]] (''Islas Canarias'')
* [[Cantabria]]
* [[Castile-La Mancha]] (''Castilla-La Mancha'')
* [[Castile and Leon]] (''Castilla y León'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])
* [[Catalonia]] (''Catalunya'' in [[catalan language|Catalan]]/''Cataluña'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]/ ''Catalunha'' in [[Aranese]])
* [[Extremadura]]
* [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] 
* [[La Rioja]]
* [[Madrid (autonomous community)|Madrid]]
* [[Murcia (autonomous community)|Murcia]]
* [[Navarre]] (''Nafarroa'' in [[Basque language|Basque]]/''Navarra'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])
* [[Land of Valencia]] (''Comunitat Valenciana'' in [[Valencian dialect|Valencian]] /''Comunidad Valenciana'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], as official denominations).

===Provinces===
{{main articles|[[Provinces of Spain]] and [[Comarcas of Spain]]}}

The Spanish kingdom has also a provincial structure. Spain is divided into 50 [[Provinces|provinces]] (''provincias''). This structure is prior to that of the autonomous communities (dates back to 1833). Therefore, autonomous communities group provinces (for instance, [[Extremadura]] is made of two provinces: [[Cáceres (province)|Cáceres]] and [[Badajoz (province)|Badajoz]]). The autonomous communities of [[Asturias]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Cantabria]], [[La Rioja]], [[Navarre]], [[Murcia]], and [[Madrid]] (the nation's [[Capital city|capital]]) are each composed of a single province. Traditionally, provinces are usually subdivided into historic regions or ''comarcas''.

===Places of sovereignty===
There are also five enclaves (''[[plaza de soberanía|plazas de soberanía]]'') on and off the [[Africa|African]] coast: the cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] are administered as autonomous cities, an intermediate status between cities and communities; the islands of the [[Islas Chafarinas]], [[Penon de Alhucemas|Peñón de Alhucemas]], and [[Penon de Velez de la Gomera|Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera]] are under direct Spanish administration.

The [[Canary islands]], [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], although not officially historic communities, enjoy a special status.

==Geography==
[[Image:spain.png|right|thumb|330px|Map of mainland Spain]]
{{main|Geography of Spain}}
Mainland Spain is dominated by high plateaus and mountain ranges such as the [[Pyrenees]] or the [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]. Running from these heights are several major rivers such as the [[Tajo]], the [[Ebro]], the [[Duero]], the [[Guadiana]] and the [[Guadalquivir]]. Alluvial plains are found along the coast, the largest of which is that of the Guadalquivir in [[Andalusia]], in the east there are alluvial plains with medium rivers like [[Segura]], [[Júcar]] and [[Turia]]. Spain is bound to the east by [[Mediterranean Sea]] (containing the [[Balearic Islands]]), to the north by the [[Bay of Biscay]] and to its west by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], where the [[Canary Islands]] off the [[Africa]]n coast are found.

Spain's [[climate]] can be divided in four areas:

*The Mediterranean: mostly temperate in the eastern and southern part of the country; rainy seasons are spring and autumn. Mild summers with pleasant temperatures. ''Hot records'': Murcia 47.2&nbsp;°C, Malaga 44.2&nbsp;°C, Valencia 42.5&nbsp;°C, Alicante 41.4&nbsp;°C, Palma of Mallorca 40.6&nbsp;°C, Barcelona 39.8&nbsp;°C. ''Low records'': Gerona -13.0&nbsp;°C, Barcelona -10.0&nbsp;°C, Valencia -7.2&nbsp;°C, Murcia -6.0&nbsp;°C, Alicante -4.6&nbsp;°C, Malaga -3.8&nbsp;°C.

*The interior: Very cold winters (frequent snow in the north) and hot summers. ''Hot records'': Sevilla 47.0&nbsp;°C, Cordoba 46.6&nbsp;°C, Badajoz 45.0&nbsp;°C, Albacete and Zaragoza 42.6&nbsp;°C, Madrid 42.2&nbsp;°C, Burgos 41.8&nbsp;°C, Valladolid 40.2&nbsp;°C. ''Low records'': Albacete -24.0&nbsp;&nbsp;°C, Burgos -22.0&nbsp;°C, Salamanca -20.0&nbsp;°C, Teruel -19.0&nbsp;°C, Madrid -14.8&nbsp;°C, Sevilla -5.5&nbsp;°C.

===Territorial disputes===
====Territories claimed by Spain====
Spain has called for the return of [[Gibraltar]], a tiny [[United Kingdom|British]] possession on its southern coast. It was conquered during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1704 and was ceded to Britain in perpetuity in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. An overwhelming majority of Gibraltar's 30 000 inhabitants want to remain British, as they have repeatedly proven in Referendums regarding this issue. The UN resolutions (2231 (XXI) and 2353 (XXII)) call on the UK and Spain to reach an agreement to finish the colonial status of Gibraltar. According to Spain, these resolutions overule the Treaty of Utrecht. Besides, the current extension of Gibraltar does not correspond to that of the Treaty. Gibraltar is officially a non-self governing territory or colony according to the UN.

====Spanish territories claimed by other countries====
[[Morocco]] claims the Spanish cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] and the uninhabited [[Penon de Velez de la Gomera|Vélez]], [[Penon de Alhucemas|Alhucemas]], [[Islas Chafarinas|Chafarinas]], and [[Isla Perejil|Perejil]] islands, all on the Northern coast of [[Africa]]. Morocco points out that those territories were obtained when Morocco could not do anything to prevent it and has never signed treaties ceding them. Spain claims that these territories are integral parts of Spain and have been Spanish or linked to Spain since before the Islamic invasion of Spain in 711 and returned to Spanish rule only a few years after the conquest of Granada. Spain claims that Morocco's only claim on these territories is geographical. Parallelism with Egyptian ownership of the Sinai (in Asia) or Turkish ownership of Istambul (in Europe) is often used to support the Spanish position.

[[Portugal]] does not recognize Spain's sovereignty over the territory of [[Olivenza]]. Portuguese claim the Treaty of Vienna (1815), to which Spain was a signatory, stipulated return of the territory to Portugal. Spanish allege the Treaty of Vienna left unaffected the Treaty of Badajoz which gave the territory to Spain and just encouraged the parties to reach a diplomatic settlement.

==Economy==
[[image:2e es.png|thumb|right|150px|King Juan Carlos, depicted on the Spanish €2 coin]]
[[Image:Barcelona Dockside Arial sho.jpg|thumb|Barcelona dockside]]
{{main|Economy of Spain}}
Spain's mixed economy supports a GDP that on a per capita basis is 87% that of the four leading [[Western Europe|West Europe]]an economies. The centre-right government of former Prime Minister [[Aznar]] worked to gain admission to the first group of countries launching the European single [[currency]], the [[euro]], on [[1 January]] [[1999]]. The Aznar administration continued to advocate liberalization, privatisation, and deregulation of the economy and introduced some [[tax]] reforms to that end. [[Unemployment]] fell steadily under the Aznar and Zapatero administration. It now is 8,7% (December 2005). This (still unacceptable) level must be seen in the light of levels of over 20% at the start of the 1990s. Growth of 2.4% in 2003 was satisfactory given the background of a faltering European economy, and has steadied since at an annualised rate of about 3.3% in mid 2005. The Prime Minister [[Rodríguez Zapatero]], whose party won the election three days after the [[Madrid]] train bombings in March 2004, plans to reduce government intervention in business, combat tax fraud, and support innovation, research and development, but also intends to reintroduce labour market regulations that had been scrapped by the Aznar government. Adjusting to the monetary and other economic policies of an integrated Europe - and reducing unemployment - will pose challenges to Spain over the next few years. According to [http://www.worldbank.org/data/databytopic/GDP.pdf World Bank GDP figures]from 2004, Spain has the 8th largest economy in the world.

There is general concern that Spain's model of economic growth (based largely on mass tourism, the construction industry, and manufacturing sectors) is faltering and may prove unsustainable over the long term. The first report of the Observatory on Sustainability (''Observatorio de Sostenibilidad'') - published in 2005 and funded by Spain's Ministry of the Environment and Alcalá University - reveals that the country's per capita GDP grew by 25% over the last ten years, while greenhouse gas emissions have risen by 45% since 1990. Although Spain's population grew by less than 5% between 1990 and 2000, urban areas expanded by no less than 25% over the same period. Meanwhile, Spain's energy consumption has doubled over the last 20 years and is currently rising by 6% per annum. This is particularly worrying for a country whose dependence on imported oil (meeting roughly 80% of Spain's energy needs) is one of the greatest in the EU. Large-scale unsustainable development is clearly visible along Spain's Mediterranean coast in the form of housing and tourist complexes, which are placing severe strain on local land and water resources.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Spain}}
The Spanish Constitution, although affirming the sovereignty of the Spanish Nation, recognizes historical nationalities.

The Castilian-derived '''[[Spanish language|Spanish]]''' (called both ''español'' and ''castellano'' in the language itself) is the official language throughout Spain, but other [[regional language]]s are also spoken. Without mentioning them by name, the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]] recognizes the possibility of regional languages being co-official in their respective autonomous communities. The following languages are co-official with Spanish according to the appropriate Autonomy Statute (Spain)|Autonomy Statutes.

* '''[[Catalan language|Catalan]]''' (''català'') in [[Catalonia]] (''Catalunya''), the [[Balearic Islands]] (''Illes Balears''), [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] (''València'') and [[Aragon]]'s eastern strip (''Aragó'').
* '''[[Basque language|Basque]]''' (''euskara'') in [[Basque Country]] (''Euskadi''), and parts of [[Navarre]] (Nafarroa). Basque is not known to be related to any other language.
* '''[[Galician language|Galician]]''' (''galego'') in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (''Galicia'' or ''Galiza'').
* '''[[Occitan language|Occitan]]''' (the [[Aranese]] dialect). Spoken in the [[Val d'Aran]] in Catalonia.

Catalan, Galician, Aranese (Occitan) and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (Castilian) are all descended from [[Latin]] and have their own dialects, some championed as separate languages by their speakers (the [[Valencià]] of [[València]], a dialect of Catalan, is one example).
[[Image:Map-Hispanophone World.png|thumb|left|200px|Spain's legacy: a map of the [[Spanish language|Hispanophone]] world.]]

There are also some other surviving [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[minority language]]s: [[Asturian language|Asturian / Leonese]], in [[Asturias]] and parts of [[León (province)|Leon]], [[Zamora]] and [[Salamanca]], and the [[Extremaduran language|Extremaduran]] in [[Caceres]] and [[Salamanca]], both descendants of the historical Astur-Leonese dialect; the [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] or ''fabla'' in part of [[Aragon]]; the ''fala'', spoken in three villages of Extremadura; and some Portuguese dialectal towns in Extremadura and Castile-Leon. However, unlike Catalan, Galician, and Basque, these do not have any official status.

In the touristic areas of the Mediterranean ''[[costa]]s'' and the islands, German and English are spoken by tourists, foreign residents and tourism workers.

Many linguists claim that most of the Spanish language variants spoken in [[Latin America]] (Mexican, Argentinian, Colombian, Peruvian, etc. variants) descended from the Spanish spoken in south-western Spain ([[Andalusia]], [[Extremadura]] and Canary Islands).

==Identities==
The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], in its second article, recognizes historic entities ("nationalities," a carefully chosen word in order to avoid "nations") and regions, inside the unity of the Spanish nation.

But Spain's identity is sometimes, in fact, an overlap of different regional identities, some of them even conflicting.

Castile is considered by many to be the "core" of Spain. However, this may just be a reflection of the fact that the Castilian national identity was the first one to be quashed by the Spanish Empire in the revolt of the Communards (''[[comuneros]]'') in 1518-1520.

The opposite is the case of a large part of Catalans, Basques and, in some measure, Galicians, who quite frequently identify primarily with [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country]] first, with Spain only second, or even third, after Europe. For example, according to the last CIS survey, 44% of Basques identify themselves first as Basques (only 8% first as Spaniards); 40% of Catalans do so with their autonomous community (20% identify firstly with Spain), and 32% Galicians with Galicia (9% with Spain). Even more remarkable, almost all communities have a majority of people identifying as much with Spain as with the Autonomous Community (except Madrid, where Spain is the primary identity, and Catalonia, Basque Country and Balearics, where people tend to identity more with their Autonomous Community). Even Castille-Leon has 57% of people regarding themselves as much Spaniards as they are Castilians.

The situation is even more confusing, since there are regions with ambiguous identities, like [[Navarre]], [[Valencia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], etc. There has been a lot of internal migration ([[rural exodus]]) from regions like Galicia, Andalusia and Extremadura to Madrid, Catalonia, Basque Country and the islands.

Spain became a unified crown with the union of [[Castile]] and [[Aragon]] and the conquest of Granada in 1492, and the annexation of [[Navarre]] in 1515. Until 1714, Spain was a loose confederation of kingdoms and statelets under one king, until King [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] (Felipe V) removed the autonomous status of the Aragonese crown. Navarre and the Basque Provinces, however, kept a high degree of autonomy within their legal and financial system ([[Fueros]]). Moreover, the creation of a unified state in the 19th and 20th centuries has led to the present situation, which is apparently simple, but sometimes extremely confusing. During the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931&ndash;1936), Catalonia, the Basque country and Galicia were given limited self-government, which was lost after the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936&ndash;1939) and restored in 1978 during the [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]].

===Minority groups===
Since the 16th century, the most important minority group in the country have been the [[Gitanos]]. Other historical minorities are [[Merchero]]s (or [[Quinqui]]s) and [[Vaqueiros de alzada]]. The latter, meaning "mountain  cattle ranchers" dwell in mountain ranges in the Principality of Asturias and have kept historically apart from the valley dwellers.

The number of [[immigrant]]s or foreign residents has tripled to 3,691,547 in less than five years, according the latest figures (2005) of National Statics Institute. They currently make up around 8.5 % of the official total population. The rise of population in Spain in recent years was largely due to them. Nearly half of all immigrants have neither residence nor work permits.

As of October 2005, and according to the official Ministry of Labour data [http://extranjeros.mtas.es/en/general/ObservatorioPermanente_index.html Permanent Immigration Observatory], there are 2,597,014 foreigners with valid residence permits, of which the largest are 552,694 EU citizens, also with 144,283 Britons, 473,048 Moroccans, 333,251 Ecuadorians, 192,965 Colombians and 174,590 Romanians.

A sizeable and increasing number of Spanish citizens (as Spain applies ''[[ius soli]]'' and provides special measures for immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries in order to acquire the citizenship) also descend from these communities.

==Religion==
[[Image:1928SpanishStamppeseta-pio11-alfonso13.jpg|thumb|right|240px|1928 Spanish one-peseta postage stamp pairs [[Pope Pius XI]] and [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]]]]
{{seealso|Religion in Spain}}
[[Roman Catholic]]ism is, by far, the most popular religion in the country. According to several sources (CIA World Fact Book 2005, Spanish official polls and others), from 80% to 94% self-identify as Catholics, whereas around 6% to 13% identify with either other religions or none at all. Spain is also the location of one of the Roman Catholic church's most important [[List of holy cities|holy cities]]; [[Santo Toribio de Liébana]], which holds the largest single piece of the [[true cross]]. It is important to note, however, that many Spaniards identify themselves as Catholics just because they were baptised, even though they are not very religious at all (in fact some polls show that 14% do not believe in any God). According to recent surveys (New York Times, April 19, 2005) only around 18 % of Spaniards regularly attend mass. Of those under 30, only about 14 % attend.

Further evidence of the secular nature of modern Spain can be seen in the widespread support for the legalisation of [[same-sex marriage in Spain]] - over 70% of Spaniards support gay marriage according to a 2004 study by the [http://www.cis.es/ Centre of Sociological Investigations]. Indeed, in June 2005 a bill was passed by 187 votes to 147 to allow gay marriage, making Spain the third country in the European Union to allow same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual ones. This vote was split along conservative-liberal lines, with PSOE and other left-leaning parties supporting the measure and PP against it. Proposed changes to the divorce laws to make the process quicker and to eliminate the need for a guilty party are also popular. In truth, there is a growing rift between the urban areas of Spain and parts of the periphery, such as Catalonia, who support the secularisation of the state, and the rural areas and conservative parts of the periphery, like Galicia, who support keeping the social ideals inherent with their religious past.

According to membership [http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_jw.html], the second religion of Spain is the organization of the [[Jehovah's Witness]]es with 103,784 active publishers; there are also many Protestant denominations, all of them with less than 50&nbsp;000 members, and about 20,000 [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|Mormon]]s. [[Evangelism]] has been better received among [[Gypsies]] than among the general population; pastors have integrated [[flamenco]] music in their liturgy. Taken together, all self-described "Evangelicals" slightly surpass Jehovah's Witnesses in number. Other religious faiths represented in Spain include the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] Community.

The recent waves of immigration have led to an increasing number of [[Muslim]]s, who have about 800,000 members. Muslims were forcibly converted in 1492 and then expelled in the 16th century. Also, many Spanish youth are converting to the religion, discovering Muslim roots and finding the religion attractive.

Since the expulsion of the [[Sephardi]]m in 1492, [[Judaism]] was practically nonexistent until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country. Currently there are around 14,000 Jews in Spain, all arrivals in the past century. There are also many Spaniards (in Spain and abroad) who claim Jewish ancestry to the [[Conversos]], and still practice certain customs. Spain is believed to have been about 8 % [[Judaism|Jewish]] on the eve of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. {{see|History of the Jews in Spain}}

Over the past thirty years, Spain has become a more secularised society. The number of believers has decreased significantly and for those who believe the degree of accordance and practice to their church is diverse.

According to the latest official poll [http://www.cis.es/Catalogo/Estudio.aspx?year=&barometro=&ultimosestudios=&tema=119&estudio=2170&cuestionario=2190&muestra=5485 (CIS, 2002)], 80% of Spaniards self-identify as [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]], 12% as ''non-believer'', and 1% as ''other'' (the remaining 7% declined to state). Of the 1.4% identifying as ''other'', 29% identified as [[Evangelical Christian]], 26% as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and 3.5% as Muslim (the rest either mentioned smaller religions or declined to state). According to the same poll, 73% believe in God, 14% don't and 12% are unsure (1% declined to state). Additionally, according to this poll, only 41% believe in [[Heaven]]. 24% of the Spaniards think that the [[Bible]] is just a fable. Only 25% of [[Catholics]] go to church at least once a week.
