The '''Kingdom of Spain''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Galician]]: ''Reino de España''; [[Catalan]]: ''Regne d'Espanya''; [[Basque]]: ''Espainiako Erresuma''; [[Occitan]]: ''Regne d'Espanha'') is the larger of the two countries that make up the Iberian peninsula—the other is [[Portugal]]—located in southwestern Europe. To the west (and, in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], south), it borders [[Portugal]]. To the south, it borders [[Gibraltar]] and, through its cities in North Africa ([[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]), [[Morocco]]. To the northeast, along the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, it borders [[France]] and the tiny [[principality]] of [[Andorra]]. It also includes the [[Balearic Islands]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Canary Islands]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and a number of uninhabited islands on the Mediterranean side of the [[strait of Gibraltar]], known as ''[[Plazas de soberanía]]'', such as the [[Islas Chafarinas|Chafarine]] islands, the "rocks" (''peñones'') of [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera|Vélez]] and [[Peñón de Alhucemas|Alhucemas]], and the tiny [[Isla Perejil]] ([[Disputed territories|disputed]]). In the Northeast along the [[Pyrenees]], a small [[exclave]] town called [[Llívia]] in [[Catalonia]] is surrounded by [[France|French]] territory.

==History==
{{main|History of Spain}}

===Prehistory===
The [[indigenous peoples]] peoples  of the [[Iberian peninsula]], consisting of a number of separate tribes, are given the generic name of [[Iberians]]. This may have included the [[Basque people|Basque]]s, as one of the pre-Celtic people. The most important culture of this period is that of the city of [[Tartessos]]. Beginning in the [[9th century BC]], [[Celt]]ic tribes entered the [[Iberian peninsula]] through the Pyrenees and settled throughout the peninsula, becoming the [[Celtiberian]]s.

The seafaring [[Phoenicians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Carthaginians]] successively settled along the Mediterranean coast and founded trading colonies there over a period of several centuries.

Around 1100 BCE, Phoenician merchants founded the trading colony of [[Gadir]] or Gades (modern day [[Cádiz]]) near Tartessos. In the 8th century BC the first Greek colonies, such as Emporion (modern [[Empúries]]), were founded along the Mediterranean coast on the East, leaving the south coast to the Phoenicians. The Greeks are responsible for the name Iberia, after the river Iber ([[Ebro]] in Spanish). In the 6th century BC the [[Carthaginians]] arrived in Iberia while struggling with the Greeks for control of the Western Mediterranean. Their most important colony was [[Carthago Nova]] (Latin name of modern day [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]).

On March 11, 2004, a series of bombs exploded in commuter trains in Madrid, Spain. These resulted in 192 people dead and 1,460 wounded. It also had a significant effect on the upcoming elections in Spain, due in part to the ruling government's insistence that the ETA was the prime suspect in the bombings, even as the evidence of Muslim extremist terrorism rapidly emerged from the police investigation and the international press. {{see|11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings}}

==Administrative divisions==
Administratively, Spain is divided into 50 [[provinces of Spain|provinces]], grouped into 17 [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] and 2 autonomous cities with high degree of autonomy.

===Autonomous communities===
[[Image:ccaa-spain.png|thumb|400px|Autonomous communities of Spain]]
{{main|Autonomous communities of Spain}}
Spain consists of 17 autonomous communities (''comunidades autónomas'') and 2 autonomous cities (''ciudades autónomas''; [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]).
* [[Andalusia]] (''Andalucía'')
* [[Aragon]] (''Aragón'')
* [[Asturias|Principality of Asturias]] (''Principáu d'Asturies'' in [[Asturian language|Asturian]]/''Principado de Asturias'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])
* [[Balearic Islands]] (''Illes Balears'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] / ''Islas Baleares'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])
* [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (''Euskadi'' in [[Basque language|Basque]]/''País Vasco'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])
* [[Canary Islands]] (''Islas Canarias'')
* [[Cantabria]]
* [[Castile-La Mancha]] (''Castilla-La Mancha'')
* [[Castile and Leon]] (''Castilla y León'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])
* [[Catalonia]] (''Catalunya'' in [[catalan language|Catalan]]/''Cataluña'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]/ ''Catalunha'' in [[Aranese]])
* [[Extremadura]]
* [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] 
* [[La Rioja]]
* [[Madrid (autonomous community)|Madrid]]
* [[Murcia (autonomous community)|Murcia]]
* [[Navarre]] (''Nafarroa'' in [[Basque language|Basque]]/''Navarra'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])
* [[Land of Valencia]] (''Comunitat Valenciana'' in [[Valencian dialect|Valencian]] /''Comunidad Valenciana'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], as official denominations).

===Provinces===
{{main articles|[[Provinces of Spain]] and [[Comarcas of Spain]]}}

The Spanish kingdom has also a provincial structure. Spain is divided into 50 [[Provinces|provinces]] (''provincias''). This structure is prior to that of the autonomous communities (dates back to 1833). Therefore, autonomous communities group provinces (for instance, [[Extremadura]] is made of two provinces: [[Cáceres (province)|Cáceres]] and [[Badajoz (province)|Badajoz]]). The autonomous communities of [[Asturias]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Cantabria]], [[La Rioja]], [[Navarre]], [[Murcia]], and [[Madrid]] (the nation's [[Capital city|capital]]) are each composed of a single province. Traditionally, provinces are usually subdivided into historic regions or ''comarcas''.

===Places of sovereignty===
There are also five enclaves (''[[plaza de soberanía|plazas de soberanía]]'') on and off the [[Africa|African]] coast: the cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] are administered as autonomous cities, an intermediate status between cities and communities; the islands of the [[Islas Chafarinas]], [[Penon de Alhucemas|Peñón de Alhucemas]], and [[Penon de Velez de la Gomera|Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera]] are under direct Spanish administration.

The [[Canary islands]], [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], although not officially historic communities, enjoy a special status.

==Geography==
[[Image:spain.png|right|thumb|330px|Map of mainland Spain]]
{{main|Geography of Spain}}
Mainland Spain is dominated by high plateaus and mountain ranges such as the [[Pyrenees]] or the [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]. Running from these heights are several major rivers such as the [[Tajo]], the [[Ebro]], the [[Duero]], the [[Guadiana]] and the [[Guadalquivir]]. Alluvial plains are found along the coast, the largest of which is that of the Guadalquivir in [[Andalusia]], in the east there are alluvial plains with medium rivers like [[Segura]], [[Júcar]] and [[Turia]]. Spain is bound to the east by [[Mediterranean Sea]] (containing the [[Balearic Islands]]), to the north by the [[Bay of Biscay]] and to its west by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], where the [[Canary Islands]] off the [[Africa]]n coast are found.

Spain's [[climate]] can be divided in four areas:

*The Mediterranean: mostly temperate in the eastern and southern part of the country; rainy seasons are spring and autumn. Mild summers with pleasant temperatures. ''Hot records'': Murcia 47.2&nbsp;°C, Malaga 44.2&nbsp;°C, Valencia 42.5&nbsp;°C, Alicante 41.4&nbsp;°C, Palma of Mallorca 40.6&nbsp;°C, Barcelona 39.8&nbsp;°C. ''Low records'': Gerona -13.0&nbsp;°C, Barcelona -10.0&nbsp;°C, Valencia -7.2&nbsp;°C, Murcia -6.0&nbsp;°C, Alicante -4.6&nbsp;°C, Malaga -3.8&nbsp;°C.

*The interior: Very cold winters (frequent snow in the north) and hot summers. ''Hot records'': Sevilla 47.0&nbsp;°C, Cordoba 46.6&nbsp;°C, Badajoz 45.0&nbsp;°C, Albacete and Zaragoza 42.6&nbsp;°C, Madrid 42.2&nbsp;°C, Burgos 41.8&nbsp;°C, Valladolid 40.2&nbsp;°C. ''Low records'': Albacete -24.0&nbsp;&nbsp;°C, Burgos -22.0&nbsp;°C, Salamanca -20.0&nbsp;°C, Teruel -19.0&nbsp;°C, Madrid -14.8&nbsp;°C, Sevilla -5.5&nbsp;°C.

*Northern Atlantic coast: precipitations mostly in winter, with mild summers (slightly cold). ''Hot records'': Bilbao 42.0&nbsp;°C, La Coruña 37.6&nbsp;°C, Gijón 36.4&nbsp;°C. ''Low records'': Bilbao -8.6&nbsp;°C, Oviedo -6.0&nbsp;°C, Gijon and La Coruña -4.8&nbsp;°C.

*The Canary Islands: subtropical weather, with mild temperatures (18&nbsp;°C to 24&nbsp;°C [[Celsius]]) throughout the year. ''Hot records'': Santa Cruz de Tenerife 42.6&nbsp;°C. ''Low records'': Santa Cruz de Tenerife 8.1&nbsp;°C.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Spain}}
The Spanish Constitution, although affirming the sovereignty of the Spanish Nation, recognizes historical nationalities.

The Castilian-derived '''[[Spanish language|Spanish]]''' (called both ''español'' and ''castellano'' in the language itself) is the official language throughout Spain, but other [[regional language]]s are also spoken. Without mentioning them by name, the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]] recognizes the possibility of regional languages being co-official in their respective autonomous communities. The following languages are co-official with Spanish according to the appropriate Autonomy Statute (Spain)|Autonomy Statutes.

* '''[[Catalan language|Catalan]]''' (''català'') in [[Catalonia]] (''Catalunya''), the [[Balearic Islands]] (''Illes Balears''), [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] (''València'') and [[Aragon]]'s eastern strip (''Aragó'').
* '''[[Basque language|Basque]]''' (''euskara'') in [[Basque Country]] (''Euskadi''), and parts of [[Navarre]] (Nafarroa). Basque is not known to be related to any other language.
* '''[[Galician language|Galician]]''' (''galego'') in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (''Galicia'' or ''Galiza'').
* '''[[Occitan language|Occitan]]''' (the [[Aranese]] dialect). Spoken in the [[Val d'Aran]] in Catalonia.

Catalan, Galician, Aranese (Occitan) and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (Castilian) are all descended from [[Latin]] and have their own dialects, some championed as separate languages by their speakers (the [[Valencià]] of [[València]], a dialect of Catalan, is one example).
[[Image:Map-Hispanophone World.png|thumb|left|200px|Spain's legacy: a map of the [[Spanish language|Hispanophone]] world.]]

There are also some other surviving [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[minority language]]s: [[Asturian language|Asturian / Leonese]], in [[Asturias]] and parts of [[León (province)|Leon]], [[Zamora]] and [[Salamanca]], and the [[Extremaduran language|Extremaduran]] in [[Caceres]] and [[Salamanca]], both descendants of the historical Astur-Leonese dialect; the [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] or ''fabla'' in part of [[Aragon]]; the ''fala'', spoken in three villages of Extremadura; and some Portuguese dialectal towns in Extremadura and Castile-Leon. However, unlike Catalan, Galician, and Basque, these do not have any official status.

In the touristic areas of the Mediterranean ''[[costa]]s'' and the islands, German and English are spoken by tourists, foreign residents and tourism workers.

Many linguists claim that most of the Spanish language variants spoken in [[Latin America]] (Mexican, Argentinian, Colombian, Peruvian, etc. variants) descended from the Spanish spoken in south-western Spain ([[Andalusia]], [[Extremadura]] and Canary Islands).
