'''Allan Pineda Lindo''', (b. [[28 November]] [[1974]]) is better known as '''''Apl.de.ap'''''.  He was born in the impoverished district of Sapang Bato in [[Angeles City]] in the province of [[Pampanga]], [[Philippines]]. He is of [[Afro-Filipino]] descent. 

Apl.de.ap is part of a famous [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group, the [[Black Eyed Peas]]. During his rough childhood days, Apl.de.ap grew up in [[Barrio]] Sapang Bato. At the age of 14 years old, he was adopted by the ''Hudgens'', an American tourist family, and moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], leaving behind his birth family and country. However, he has stayed very loyal to both his biological family and to the Philippines, identifying himself as a Filipino American. He explains his life story in a song called "The Apl Song" found on the Black Eyed Peas 2003 album Elephunk (Track 11). This song has a full chorus in Tagalog (Filipino) taken from the [[Asin]] song "Balita".

<p class='maintext'>As a member of the popular rap group Black Eyed Peas, Apl.de.Ap, born Allan Pineda Lindo, has overcome tremendous odds by achieving success despite his humble beginnings. In an interview on VH1, he recalls "In the Philippines, you've got to dig up the ground to do a number two, and then you've got to cover it up.  You got to pump the water out of the ground to wash your clothes and your hands.  That's my ghetto!"  Apl.de.Ap left Pampanga at age 14 to join his adoptive family in Southern California.  There, he and childhood friend Will (aka Will.I.Am) formed a break dancing crew called, "Tribe Nation," which would then evolve into Black Eyed Peas when the duo added mike skills and rapper Jaime "Taboo" Gomez to the mix. Their first album, <em>Behind the Front</em> was released in 1998 to critical acclaim, and was followed by <em> Bridging the Gap</em> in 2000 featuring guest appearance by Macy Gray and members of Jurassic 5 and De La Soul.</p>                                                                                                                                    <p class="maintext">Unlike some Filipinos who have shied away from acknowledging their Pinoy roots, Apl.de.Ap embraces his heritage, even in his work. His landmark "The Apl Song," from 2003's <em>Elephunk</em>, features a chorus sung completely in Tagalog and speaks of his experience as a Filipino American. Its accompanying video, which reached number one in the Philippines, with its cameo appearances by fellow Fil-Ams, Dante Basco and Chad Hugo, is a touching tribute to the Filipinos who fought
 for the U.S. in World War II.<p/>
