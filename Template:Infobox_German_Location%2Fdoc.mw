==Important Features==
Since [[:de:Vorlage:Infobox Ort in Deutschland]] is being introduced to many German locations in the German Wikipedia, the variable fields here use the same names to make it easier for editors to import infobox information from the German Wikipedia to the English one. <br>For many fields, German values can be given (i.e. without translation to English) and will be displayed in English. 
*''eg. By entering "Bundesland = Bayern", the infobox will display "State: Bavaria"''

The variables with English names relate to features that do not exist in ''Infobox Ort in Deutschland''.

Major new features, compared to [[Template:Infobox Town DE]]:
*No longer need a location map for each entry. By entering the geographical co-ordinates, a map is automatically displayed.
*Population density automatically calculated upon entry of population and area
*Area, population density and elevation automatically displayed in both metric and imperial units
*Auto-categorisation of entries, depending on values entered
*Optional 2nd map, to display location in more detail.

Major new features, compared to [[:de:Vorlage:Infobox Ort in Deutschland]]:
*Can give year of city foundation: places article in "Category: xxxx establishments"
*Can display representative photo of location (a feature of Infobox Town DE, which, for some reason, was never used) (eg. see [[Cologne]])
*In addition to displaying the political party of the mayor/lord mayor/etc., it is also possible to display the ruling parties. Currently, a coalition of up to 3 parties is supported - if more are needed, please report it on the template talk page)  (eg. see [[Braunschweig]])
