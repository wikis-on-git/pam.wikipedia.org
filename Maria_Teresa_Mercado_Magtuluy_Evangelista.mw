Marakal na murin banuang peindalan,

Ketang kayarian lele nitang dagatan,

Dalagang balu yu, karin manuknangan,

Annabel Lee, kaniti mipalagyuan.

Iting mutya, king isip ku magdatunan,

A kabud lugud ku’t kakung luluguran.


Anak ku pa’t ‘ya man anak yang malati,

Ketang kayarian nitang dagat a mauli,

Dapot mikalugud, lugud maigit dili,

Aku’t ing kanakung sintang Annabel Lee.

At ring serapines Banua e mawili,

Nune atmuno king kariria kekami.


At iti ing kanita a meging sangkan,

Ketang kayarian lele nitang dagatan,

Anging babagul king biga menibatan,

Pakayungkung Annabel Lee kung maleguan.
 
Dintang ding matas-puluk nang kaanakan,

Simsam de kaku’t teginis malautan,

Ban ikulung ketang sepulkrung kutkutan,

Ketang kayarian a lele ning dagatan.


Ding angel e la dit’ man matula Banua,

Alang patnang mariria kanaku’t keya,

Wa! Oita ing sangkan a beluan ding sabla,

Ketang kayarian lele ning dagat aita,

‘Tang bengi, bagul ning angin aibat biga,

Pengayungkung pete Annabel Lee-ng sinta.


Dapot ing lugud mi, king lugud maigit pa,

Kesa karetang kekami mas makatua,

Kesa karetang kekami a mas-biasa,

At ala ni angel karin babo Banua,

Ni ding demonio lalam ning dagat aita,

E de akawani kaladua ku king kaladua--

Na ning malagung Annabel Lee kung sinta.


Ing bulan e sunlag nung paninap ala--

Kening malagung Annabel Lee kung sinta,

Tala e man sunlag dapot maslag ya mata,

Ya’ing malagung Annabel Lee kung sinta.

Inia kabukas siping ning keyang bangke,

Ning kanakung sinta, asawa ku at bie,

Karin king sepulkru nitang dagat lele,

Karin king aun nitang dagat a mangye.

ANNABEL LEE
By Edgar Allan Poe

                   
It was many and many a year ago,

In a kingdom by the sea,

That a maiden there lived whom you may know,

By the name of Annabel Lee.

And this maiden, lived with no other thought,

Than to love and be loved by me.


I was a child and she was a child,

In this kingdom by the sea,

But we loved with a love that was more than love,

I and my Annabel Lee.

With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven,

Coveted her and me.


And this was the reason that long ago,

In this kingdom by the sea,

A wind blew out of the cloud,

Chilling my beautiful Annabel Lee.

So that her high-born kinsman came,

And bore her away from me,

To shut her up in a sepulcher,

In this kingdom by the sea.


The angels not half so happy in heaven,

Went envying her and me,

Yes! That was the reason as all men know,

In this kingdom by the sea,

That the wind came out of the cloud by night,

Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.


But our love, it was stronger by far than the love,

Of those who were older than we,

Of many far wiser than we,

And neither the angels in Heaven above,

Nor the demons down under the sea,

Can ever dissever my soul from the soul--

Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.


For the moon never beams without giving me dreams--

Of the beautiful Annabel Lee,

And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes,

Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.

And so all the night-tide, I lie down by the side,

Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,

In the sepulcher there by the sea,

In her tomb by the sounding sea.


*Annabel Lee is a poem which MTMME grew to love so much as 
early as ages 6-7 and in college, 1981, MTMME declaimed it and garnered First Prize in the school’s oratorical contest.
