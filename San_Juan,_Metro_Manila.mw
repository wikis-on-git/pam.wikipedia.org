'''San Juan''' is a [[Philippine municipality|municipality]] in [[Metro Manila]] in the [[Philippines]]. It was formerly part of Rizal province until it was officially made a part of Metro Manila. The town is the second smallest among the cities and municipalities in the metropolis. Only [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] is smaller. San Juan's official long name is ''Municipality of San Juan del Monte''. This was the site of the first battle between the [[Katipunan]], the Filipino revolutionary organization, against the [[Spain|Spanish]] colonizers.

San Juan is located nearly at the center of Metro Manila. It is bordered by [[Quezon City]] to the north and east, [[Mandaluyong City]] to the south, and the city of [[Manila]] to the west. Among the many interesting places in San Juan are the [[Pinaglabanan Shrine]], which marks the first battle of the Katipunan, the [[Greenhills Shopping Center]], one of the metro's popular bargain places, especially for electronics, and [[Xavier School]], a popular all-boys high school in the Metro Manila. Also located here is Immaculate Conception Academy- Greenhills, a prestigious all-girls Filipino-Chinese Catholic school.

San Juan is famous in the Philippines for its celebration of the feast of their patron, St. John the Baptist. The locals celebrate it by getting everyone in the streets wet with water (as is done in baptism).

Former President [[Joseph Estrada]] served as mayor of San Juan, during which he is widely regarded to have vastly improved the town.
