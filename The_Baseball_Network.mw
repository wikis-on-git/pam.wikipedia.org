NBC and ABC were to create a loss-free environment for each other and keep an emerging [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which had recently made an aggressive and ultimately successful $1.58 billion bid for the [[NFL on television|television rights]] for [[National Football Conference]] games (thus, becoming a major player in the sports broadcasting game in the process), at bay. As a result of Fox's NFL gain, CBS was weakened further by [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliate changes]], as a number of stations jumped to Fox from CBS (for example, in [[Detroit]], [[WWJ-TV]] replaced [[WJBK]]).

This wasn't the first time that Major League Baseball considered creating its very own television network. Back in 1988, then [[Commissioner of Baseball|commissioner]] [[Peter Ueberroth]] contemplated creating an all-baseball basic cable channel<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=October 31, 1988|title=NATIONAL BASEBALL COMPANY?|url=https://vault.si.com/vault/1988/10/31/national-baseball-company-nbcs-world-series-telecasts-showed-its-still-the-best-at-covering-the-national-pastime|work=Sports Illustrated|location= |access-date= }}</ref> that would show as many as four games each night. Ueberroth wanted to set up a national cable package for one or two nights a week without undercutting the value of some teams' local television deals. This of course, would soon happen when Major League Baseball signed a deal to broadcast games on [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]], but prior to this, Ueberroth envisioned the owners pooling games already being shown on [[Major League Baseball on regional sports networks|regional pay-TV services]]. Viewers would see (and pay for) the telecast of the team in their market if a game was scheduled; otherwise, they would be sent games of regional or divisional interest. Eventually baseball could've also shared the channel with the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] or [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] in the off-season.

==Coverage==
The Baseball Network kicked off its coverage on July 12, 1994 on [[NBC]] with the [[1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] from [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{cite news|title=ABCs (and NBCs) of TBN's MLB plan|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED3D4C4865105C1&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|author=Barry Horn|newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=July 6, 1994|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref> This was NBC's first telecast of a Major League Baseball game since Game 5 of the [[1989 National League Championship Series]] between the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] and [[1989 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] on October 9 of [[1989 Major League Baseball season|that year]]. The NBC broadcast team consisted of [[Bob Costas]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=1994 All-Star Game Open|id=2v3pmoh8fLY}}</ref> on play-by-play, with [[Joe Morgan]] and [[Bob Uecker]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=October 15, 1995|title=SIGNOFF;World Series, as Told by Bob Uecker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/tv/signoff-world-series-as-told-by-bob-uecker.html|work=New York Times|location= |access-date= }}</ref> as analysts.

Morgan, who was also working for [[ESPN]] at the time, had spent two years at NBC in the mid-1980s and two years at ABC from 1988-1989. Uecker, the longtime voice of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], returned to national television for the first time since he worked for ABC in the 1970s and early 1980s.

More specifically, on regional Saturday night broadcasts and all non-"national" broadcasts, TBN let the two lead announcers from the opposing teams call the games involving their teams together.

Games involving either of the two Canadian-based MLB teams at the time, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Montreal Expos]], were not always included in the ''Baseball Night in America'' package. Canadian rightsholders were allowed to broadcast the games. When [[Major League Baseball on TSN|TSN]] (which owned the cable rights to the Blue Jays and Expos) covered the games in Canada, they re-broadcast the ''BNIA'' feed across their network. Typically, if the Blue Jays were idle for the day, the Expos would be featured on TSN. Also, [[CBET-DT|CBET]] (the [[CBC Television|CBC]] affiliate in [[Windsor, Ontario]]) would air Blue Jays games if the [[Detroit Tigers]] were not playing at home that night or if the Blue Jays were scheduled to play in Detroit. Whether or not the game would air in the opposing team's market would depend on which time zone they were from, or if they shared a market with another team.

The networks also promised not to begin any World Series weekend broadcasts after 7:20&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.<ref>{{cite news|title=It's A Whole, New Ballgame |url=http://articles.philly.com/1993-10-29/sports/25934892_1_abc-and-nbc-ken-schanzer-league-championship-series|author=Bill Fleischman|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=October 29, 1993|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref> When CBS held the television rights, postseason games routinely aired on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] at 8:30&nbsp;p.m. at the earliest. This meant that [[Joe Carter]]'s dramatic [[1993 World Series|World Series]] clinching home run in 1993 occurred after midnight in the East. As CBS' baseball coverage progressed, the network dropped the 8 p.m. pregame coverage (in favor of airing [[sitcom]]s such as ''[[Evening Shade]]'') before finally starting its coverage at 8:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time. The first pitch would generally arrive at approximately 8:45&nbsp;p.m.

ABC won the rights to the first dibs at the World Series in August 1993 after [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] president Dennis Swanson won a coin toss<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC Wins Coin Toss for Game 7|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/77931900.html?dids=77931900:77931900&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+13%2C+1995&author=&pub=Orlando+Sentinel&desc=ABC+WINS+COIN+TOSS+FOR+GAME+7&pqatl=google|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=September 13, 1995|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=ABC flips for Game 7 of Series|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-09-13/sports/1995256119_1_baseball-network-telecast-game-7|author=Milton Kent|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 15, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref> by calling "heads."

Schanzer agreed to the coin toss by ABC and NBC at the outset as the means of determining the order in which they would divide up the playoffs.

On that end The Baseball Network implemented a strategy that included cutting in to one game with highlights from other games -- sometimes between batters, and more often, between pitches. Therefore, viewers watching one divisional series or League Championship Series game would often see action continuing on one reduced screen while a clip from another game is shown on another screen and vice versa. The theory was that by inserting highlights, even live action from other games, into the natural lulls, The Baseball Network could produce an exciting, technology-enhanced experience. Despite the frustration of not being able to see both League Championship Series on a national level, the 1995 LCS averaged a 13.1 rating.<ref>{{cite web|title=Major League Baseball Playoff Ratings, 1976-2007|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2008/10/02/nielsen-major-league-baseball-playoffs-tv-ratings/1047/|author=Bill Gorman|website=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=[[Zap2It]]|date=October 2, 2008|access-date=18 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219074409/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2008/10/02/nielsen-major-league-baseball-playoffs-tv-ratings/1047/|archive-date=19 December 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Furthermore, [[WNBC|WNBC-TV]]/Channel 4, the NBC-owned station in the [[New York metropolitan area|New York market]], would carry Games 1 and 2 of the Yankees-Mariners series, and [[WABC-TV]]/Channel 7, owned by ABC, would carry Games 3, 4 and 5. [[WVIT]], the NBC affiliate in the [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]-[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] area, would carry the Red Sox-Indians series in Games 1 and 2, but [[WTNH]], ABC's affiliate would alternate with the Yankees in Game 3, the Red Sox in Game 4, and the Yankees in Game 5. In Ohio at the start of the playoffs, NBC stations in [[Cleveland]], [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], and [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]] would get to see the Red Sox-Indians series.

A major problem with ''Baseball Night in America''<ref>{{cite news |last=Andriesen|first=David|date=20 July 1994|title=New TV deal a shame for baseball fans|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&dat=19940720&id=-TJPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=M48DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6842,1957825&hl=en|newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record|location= |access-date= }}</ref> was the idea that viewers could not watch "important" games. Marty Noble put it in perspective by saying "With the ''Network'' determining when games will begin and which games are made available to which [[media market|TV markets]], Major League Baseball can conduct parts of its pennant races in relative secrecy." What added to the troubles of The Baseball Network was the fact that ''Baseball Night in America'' held exclusivity over every market.

Things got so bad for The Baseball Network that even local broadcasters objected to its operations. [[KSMO-TV]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], the primary over-the-air station for the [[Kansas City Royals]], went as far as to sue the Royals for breach of contract resulting from their broadcasts being "overexposed" and violating its territorial exclusivity.

ABC Sports president Dennis Swanson,<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 June 1995|title=The Baseball Network says it'll abandon baseball|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19950624&id=EUhWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GusDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6847,5969439&hl=en|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|location= |access-date= }}</ref> in announcing the dissolution of The Baseball Network, said "The fact of the matter is, Major League Baseball seems incapable at this point in time, of living with any long term relationships, whether it's with fans, with players, with the political community in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], with the advertising community here in [[Manhattan]], or with its TV partners."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Swing And A Miss|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Baseball%27s+attempt+to+juice+up+the+game+may+leave+a+sour+-+08.07.95+-+SI+Vault&expire=&urlID=432446172&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1006913%2Findex.htm&partnerID=289881|author=[[Tom Verducci]]|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=August 7, 1995}}</ref>

Shortly after the start of the strike, [[Stanford University]]'s Roger Noll<ref>{{cite news|title=TV SPORTS; The Baseball Network Says the Players' Analyst Struck Out |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/26/sports/tv-sports-the-baseball-network-says-the-players-analyst-struck-out.html|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 26, 1994}}</ref> argued that the Baseball Network deal (and the bargain-basement [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] cable renewal, which went from $100 million to $42 million because of their losses) reflected "poor business judgment on the part of management about the long-run attractiveness of their product to national broadcasters." He added that the $140 million that owners expected to share for the 1994 season (before the strike) from TBN was underestimated by "one-third to one-half" and fell below the annual average of $165 million needed to renew the TBN deal after two years. Meanwhile, Andy Zimbalist, author of ''Baseball and Billions'', and a [[Major League Baseball Players Association|players' union]] consulting economist, insisted that baseball could have done better than the TBN deal with some combination of [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]] (which offered $120 million last-ditch bid for renewal), [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] and [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]]. Baseball shut out CBS and could have waited longer before closing them out."

Five years after The Baseball Network dissolved, [[NBC Sports]] [[play-by-play]] announcer Bob Costas<ref>{{cite news|title=Later Costas' Not-so-sad Farewell To Baseball|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1995-06-25/sports/17963434_1_baseball-network-bob-costas-league-championship-series|author=Bob Raissman|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=June 25, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref> wrote in his book ''Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball''<ref>{{cite book |last=Costas|first=Bob|date=2001|title=Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz09JodkPo8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fair+Ball:+A+Fan%27s+Case+for+Baseball&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LUVYVevZJcyjyASL3IGYCA&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Baseball%20Network&f=false|location= |publisher=Crown/Archetype|page=28|isbn= |access-date= }}</ref> that The Baseball Network was "stupid and an abomination."

Costas added that both the divisional series and the League Championship Series now merited scarcely higher priority than regional coverage provided for a [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] [[college football|football]] game between [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]] and [[University of Michigan|Michigan]]. When Costas was preparing call the 1995 American League Division Series between Boston-Cleveland for NBC, he told the ''[[New York Times]]'' that "It's baseball's objective to market itself nationally, but TBN makes it a local sport." Costas added "Baseball says the wild card is supposed to save baseball, but TBN shows you as little as possible." 

According to [[Curt Smith (author)|Curt Smith]]'s book, ''The Voice – Mel Allen's Untold Story'', the longtime [[New York Yankees]] broadcaster and ''[[This Week in Baseball]]'' [[Mel Allen|host]] was quoted as saying "You wonder how anything would be worse [than CBS].

During the 1995 Division Series, the fan frustration with The Baseball Network was so bad that the mere mention of it during the [[1995 Seattle Mariners season|Mariners]]–[[1995 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] [[1995 American League Division Series|ALDS]] from public address announcer [[Tom Hutyler]] at [[Seattle]]'s [[Kingdome]] brought boos<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsbroadcastjournal.com/historian-curt-smith-examines-why-the-world-series-tv-ratings-have-dropped-since-1988/|title=Historian Curt Smith examines why the World Series TV ratings have dropped badly since 1988|last=Smith|first=Curt|date=October 29, 1988|website=Sports Broadcast Journal|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> from most of the crowd.

Others would argue that a primary reason for its failure was its abandoning of localized markets in favor of more lucrative and stable advertising contracts afforded by turning to a national model of broadcasting, similar to the [[NFL on television|National Football League's television package]], which focuses on localized games, with one or two "national" games.

In the end, the venture lost US$95 million in advertising<ref>{{cite news|title=TV SPORTS; Baseball Network Faces a Full Count|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/20/sports/tv-sports-baseball-network-faces-a-full-count.html|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 20, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref> and nearly $500 million<ref>{{cite news |last=Bodner|first=Brett|date=August 11, 2016|title=A look at possible milestones the 1994 Major League Baseball strike killed and the negative impact it left on the following season |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/milestones-1994-major-league-baseball-strike-killed-article-1.2747085|work=New York Daily News |location= |access-date= }}</ref> in national and local spending. The Baseball Network generated only about $5.5 million per team in revenue for each of the two years that it operated. To put things into proper perspective, in 1993 alone, CBS generated about $14.7 million per team. Much of this could possibly be traced back to the strike causing a huge drop in revenue, which in return caused baseball salaries to decrease by approximately $140,000 on average in 1995.
