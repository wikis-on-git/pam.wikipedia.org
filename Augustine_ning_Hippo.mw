'''Aurelius Augustinus''', '''Augustine of Hippo''', or '''Saint Augustine''' ([[November 13]], [[354]] &ndash; [[August 28]], [[430]]) was one of the most important figures in the development of [[Western Christianity]]. In [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], he is a saint and pre-eminent [[Doctor of the Church]], and the patron of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian religious order]]. Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]], especially [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], consider him to be one of the theological fountainheads of [[Reformation]] teaching on [[salvation]] and [[divine grace|grace]]. He is also considered a saint by the Orthodox Churches. Born in Africa as the eldest son of [[Monica of Hippo|Saint Monica]], he was educated in [[Rome]] and baptized in [[Milan]]. His works&mdash;including ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|The Confessions]]'', which is often called the first Western [[autobiography]]&mdash;are still read around the world.
