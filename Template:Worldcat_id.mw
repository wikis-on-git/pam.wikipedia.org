[http://worldcat.org/identities/{{{1|{{{id}}}}}} Works by or about {{{2|{{{name|{{PAGENAME}}}}}}}}] in libraries ([[WorldCat]] catalog)<noinclude>

Add the template to the "external links" section of the article to create a link to the [[Worldcat]] page associated with the article's title.
To use this template, first do a [http://worldcat.org/identities/ worldcat identities lookup]. Enter the person's name (e.g, Samuel Phillips.) This will often lead to a list of possible matches. Select the correct link (e.g., "Phillips, Samuel 1752-1802") and click on it. This will lead to the correct page on worldcat. The id is the string after the last slash in the URL, e.g., lccn-n85-221132. Now, fill in your template as follows:
:: <nowiki>{{worldcat id|id=lccn-n85-221132}}</nowiki>
:or
:: <nowiki>{{worldcat id|id=lccn-n85-221132|name=Samuel Philips, LL.D}}</nowiki>
: to display a name other than the article name

If "Works by or about" does not make sense, then use a different worldcat template:
::<nowiki> {{worldcat subject|name =Foo|id=lccn-n85-221132}} yields </nowiki>
:: Works about Foo in libraries (Worldcat catalog)
::<nowiki> {{worldcat|description="The world's libraries have a strange definition of foo. Neverheless, you can research foo"|name =Foo|id=lccn-n85-221132}} yields </nowiki>
::  The world's libraries have a strange definition of foo. Neverheless, you can research foo in libraries. (Worldcat catalog)
