This template displays the tag above and adds articles to [[:Category:Current events]] or one of its dated subcategories.

==Guidelines==
:*Note that every article on Wikipedia has a [[Wikipedia:General disclaimer|General disclaimer]] indicating that the article contents may not be accurate.
:* As an advisory to editors, the template may optionally be used in those extraordinary occasions that many editors (perhaps a hundred or more) edit an article on the same day, for example, in the case of natural disasters or other breaking news.
:* It is not intended to be used to mark an article that merely has recent news articles about the topic; if it were, hundreds of thousands of articles would have this template, with no informational consequence.
:* Generally it is expected that this template and its closely related templates will appear on an article for less than a day; occasionally longer.
:* If you desire that an article be noticed as a topic about or related to a significant current event, see [[Wikipedia:How the Current events page works]], and also [[Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates]]

==Usage==
The template takes three parameters:
* Parameter 1 overrides the word "article"
* Parameter 2 overrides the words "current event"
* Named parameter "date" categorizes into a monthly sub category for ease of maintenance. This will be added by a [[WP:BOT|bot]] if omitted.
