'''Blaise Pascal''' ({{pronounced|blez pɑskɑl}}), ([[June 19]] [[1623]]&ndash;[[August 19]] [[1662]]) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], and [[religion|religious]] [[philosopher]]. He was a [[child prodigy]] who was educated by his father. Pascal's earliest work was in the natural and applied [[science]]s where he made important contributions to the construction of mechanical [[calculator]]s, the study of [[fluid]]s, and clarified the concepts of [[pressure]] and [[vacuum]] by generalizing the work of [[Evangelista Torricelli]]. Pascal also wrote powerfully in defense of the [[scientific method]].

He was a mathematician of the first order. Pascal helped create two major new areas of research. He wrote a significant treatise on the subject of [[projective geometry]] at the age of sixteen and corresponded with [[Pierre de Fermat]] from 1654 and later on [[probability theory]], strongly influencing the development of modern [[economics]] and [[social sciences|social science]].
