[[File:TupeloMS-03-EPBirthplace.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Elvis Presley's birthplace.]]
Presley was born in a two-room [[shotgun house]], built by his father, in East Tupelo. He was an [[identical twin]]; his brother was [[stillbirth|stillborn]] and given the name Jesse Garon. Growing up as an only child he "was, everyone agreed, unusually close to his mother."<ref name="Guralnick-13">Guralnick 1994, p.13</ref> The family lived just above the [[poverty]] line and attended an [[Assembly of God]] church.<ref name=Guralnick-1994-29>Guralnick 1994, p.29</ref> Vernon has been described as "a malingerer, always averse to work and responsibility."<ref>Goldman, p.16</ref> His wife was "voluble, lively, full of spunk" and had a fondness for drink.<ref name = "Guralnick-12"/> In 1938, Vernon was jailed for an eight dollar check [[forgery]]. During his eight-month incarceration, Gladys and her son lost the family home, and they moved in with relatives.<ref name="Guralnick-12">Guralnick 1994, p.12</ref><ref name="autogenerated4">Stanley and Coffey, p.19</ref><ref name=BirthPlace>[http://www.elvis-presley-biography.com/ElvisBirthPlace.htm Elvis Presley Home].

In September 1942, Presley entered first grade at Lawhorn School in Tupelo.<ref name="autogenerated4" /> He was considered a "well-mannered and quiet child",<ref name="autogenerated4" /> but sometimes classmates threw "things at him &mdash; rotten fruit and stuff &mdash; because he was different... he stuttered and he was a mama's boy."<ref>Guralnick 1994, p.36<br />Referring to an account by singer [[Barbara Pittman]] in Humphries, Patrick (April 1, 2003). "[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0740738038 Elvis The #1 Hits: The Secret History of the Classics]" Andrews McMeel Publishing, p.117. [[Special:Booksources/0740738038|ISBN 0-7407-3803-8]].</ref>

On October 3, 1945, he made his first public performance in a singing contest at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show at the suggestion of his teacher, Mrs. J.C. Grimes.<ref name="autogenerated4" /> Dressed as a cowboy, Presley had to stand on a chair to reach the microphone and sang [[Red Foley]]'s "[[Old Shep (song)|Old Shep]]." He came fifth, winning $5 and a free ticket to all the Fair rides.<ref>"[http://elvis.com/elvisology/bio/elvis_1935_1957.asp Elvis.com Biography]"</ref>

In 1946, for his eleventh birthday, Presley received his first guitar.<ref>(October 14, 2001). "[http://www.tupelohardware.com/html/the_guitar.html Elvis Presley's First Guitar]". Tupelo Hardware.

Presley practiced playing guitar in the laundry room and also played in a five-piece band with other tenants.<ref name=Guralnick-50/> One resident, another future rockabilly pioneer, [[Johnny Burnette]], recalled, "Wherever Elvis went he'd have his guitar slung across his back... [H]e'd go in to one of the cafes or bars... Then some folks would say: 'Let's hear you sing, boy.'"<ref name=Carr-10>Carr and Farren, p.10</ref> Presley enrolled at L. C. [[Humes High School]] where some fellow students viewed his performing unfavorably; one recalled that he was "a sad, shy, not especially attractive boy" whose guitar playing was not likely to win any prizes. Presley was made fun of as a 'trashy' kind of boy, playing 'trashy' hillbilly music."<ref>Guralnick, ''Last Train to Memphis'', chapter 1.</ref> Other children however, "would beg him" to sing, but he was apparently too shy to perform.<ref name=Hopkins-33>Hopkins 2007, p.33</ref>

In September 1950, Presley occasionally worked evenings as an usher at Loew's State Theater&mdash;his first job&mdash;to boost the family income,<ref name="autogenerated5">Stanley and Coffey, p.20</ref><ref>Lichter, p.10</ref> but his mother made him quit as she feared it was affecting his school work. He worked again at Loew's in June the following year, but was fired after a fistfight over a female employee.<ref name="autogenerated5" /> He began to grow his sideburns and, when he could afford to, dress in the wild, flashy clothes of Lansky Brothers on [[Beale Street]].<ref>Lichter, p.9</ref> He stood out, especially in the conservative [[Deep South]] of the 1950s, and was mocked and bullied for it.<ref name=Guralnick-50>Guralnick 1994, p.50</ref> Childhood friend [[Red West]] said: "In the sea of 1600 pink-scalped kids at school, Elvis stood out like a camel in the arctic. ... [but] ... his appearance expressed a defiance which his demeanor did not match..."<ref name="Matthew-Walker-5">Matthew-Walker 1979, p.5</ref> Despite any unpopularity or shyness, he was a contestant in his school's 1952 "Annual Minstrel Show"<ref name=Guralnick-50 /> and won by receiving the most applause. His prize was to sing encores, including "Cold Cold Icy Fingers" and "Till I Waltz Again With You".<ref name=Carr-10 />

After graduation, Presley was still a rather shy "kid who had spent scarcely a night away from home".<ref>Guralnick 1994, p.149</ref> His third job was driving a truck for the Crown Electric Company. He began wearing his hair longer with a [[Duck's Ass|ducktail]];the style of truck drivers at that time.<ref>(1996). "[http://www.history-of-rock.com/elvis_presley.htm Elvis Presley]".

=== Early musical influences ===
Initial influences originated from his family's attendance at the [[Assemblies of God|Assembly of God]].<ref name="Guralnick-13"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: "Gospel pervaded Elvis' character and was a defining and enduring influence all of his days."<ref name="RS">George-Warren, Holly; Patricia Romanowski, Jon Pareles (2001).

A way to escape from the problems. And my way of release."<ref>"[http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/elvis-presley-quotes.html]" Quoted in ''How Stuff Works''. Retrieved on 2008-11-14. See also [[Southern gospel]].</ref> Throughout his life&mdash;in the recording studio, in private, or after concerts&mdash;Presley joined with others singing and playing [[gospel music]] at informal sessions.<ref>Guralnick 1994, p.461</ref>  The [[Southern Gospel]] singer [[Jake Hess]] was reputedly Presley's favorite singer and was a significant influence on his singing style.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jake-hess-549231.html Jake Hess Obituary</ref>

The young Presley frequently listened to local radio; his first musical hero was family friend [[Mississippi Slim]], a [[hillbilly]] singer with a radio show on Tupelo’s [[WELO]]. Presley performed occasionally on Slim’s Saturday morning show, ''Singin’ and Pickin’ Hillbilly''. "He was crazy about music... That’s all he talked about," recalls his sixth grade friend, James Ausborn, Slim’s younger brother.<ref name="autogenerated7">Guralnick 1994, p.21</ref> Before he was a teenager, music was already Presley’s "consuming passion".<ref name="autogenerated7" /> J. R. Snow, son of 1940s country superstar [[Hank Snow]], recalls that even as a young man Presley knew all of Hank Snow’s songs, "even the most obscure".<ref>Guralnick 1994, p.171</ref> Presley himself said: "I loved records by [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe|Sister Rosetta Thorpe]], ... [[Roy Acuff]], [[Ernest Tubb]]s, [[Ted Daffan]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Jimmie Davis|Jimmy Davis]] and [[Bob Wills]]."<ref>Matthew-Walker (1979), p. 3, quoted ''sic'', the correct spellings being '''[[Ernest Tubb]]''' and '''[[Jimmie Davis]]'''.</ref>

In Memphis, Presley went to record stores that had [[jukebox]]es and listening booths, playing old records and new releases for hours on end. He was an audience member at the all-night white&mdash;and black&mdash;"gospel sings" downtown.<ref name=GoodRockin-54>(August 18, 1997). "Good Rockin'". ''Newsweek'', pp.54-5</ref> Memphis [[Symphony]] Orchestra concerts at [[Overton Park]] were another Presley favorite, along with the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. His small record collection included [[Mario Lanza]] and [[Dean Martin]]. Presley later said: "I just loved music. Music period."<ref name="autogenerated7" />

Memphis had a strong tradition of blues music and Presley frequented blues as well as hillbilly venues. Many of his future recordings were inspired by local [[African American]] composers and recording artists, including [[Arthur Crudup]] and [[Rufus Thomas]].<ref>Guralnick, Peter (August 11, 2007). "[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/opinion/11guralnick.html?_r=1&oref=slogin How Did Elvis Get Turned Into a Racist?]" ''[[New York Times]]''. Retrieved August 15, 2007.</ref> [[B.B. King]] has recalled that he knew Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent [[Beale Street]].<ref>Szatmary, p.35</ref>

Presley "was an untrained musician who played [guitar and piano] entirely by ear. 'I don't read music,' he confessed, 'but I know what I like.' ... Because he was not a songwriter, Presley [would] rarely [have] material prepared for recording sessions..." When later, as a young singer, he "ventured into the recording studio he was heavily influenced by the songs he had heard on the jukebox and radio."<ref>Bertrand, p.205</ref>

=== First recordings and performances ===
{{main|Elvis Presley's Sun recordings}}
On July 18, 1953, Presley went to Sun Records' [[Memphis Recording Service]] to record "My Happiness" with "That's When Your Heartaches Begin," supposedly a present for his mother.<ref>"[http://elvis.com/elvisology/bio/elvis_1935_1957_2.asp Elvis biography: 1935–1957]." ''elvis.com''. Retrieved on 2007-10-14.</ref> During his initial introduction at Sun Records, assistant [[Marion Keisker]] asked him who he sounded like. Presley replied: "I don't sound like nobody." On January 4, 1954, he cut a second [[Acetate disc|acetate]]. At the time, Sun Records boss [[Sam Phillips]] was on the lookout for someone who could deliver a blend of black blues and [[boogie-woogie]] music; he thought it would be very popular among white people.<ref>Miller, p.71</ref> When Phillips acquired a demo recording of "Without Love (There Is Nothing)" and was unable to identify the vocalist, Keisker reminded him about the young truck driver. She called him on June 26, 1954. Presley was not able to do justice to the song (though he would record it years later).<ref>Lichter, p.12</ref> Phillips would later recall that "Elvis was probably as nervous as anybody, black or white, that I had seen in front of a microphone."<ref name="Clutton">Everything Elvis, ISBN 0-7535-0960-1</ref> Despite this, Phillips invited local musicians [[Scotty Moore|Winfield "Scotty" Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] to audition Presley. Though they were not overly impressed, a studio session was planned.<ref>"[http://www.history-of-rock.com/sam_phillips_sun_records_two.htm Sam Phillips Sun Records Two]". ''history-of-rock.com''. Retrieved on 2007-10-14.</ref>

During a recording break, Presley began "acting the fool" first with Arthur Crudup's "[[That's All Right (Mama)]]".<ref>Guralnick, Peter (1992). ''The Complete 50's Masters'' (CD booklet notes).</ref> Phillips quickly got them all to restart, and began taping. This was the sound he had been looking for.<ref>Jorgensen, p.13</ref> The group recorded other songs, including [[Bill Monroe]]'s "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]." After the session, according to Scotty Moore, Bill Black remarked: "Damn. Get that on the radio and they'll run us out of town."<ref>(August 11&ndash;August 17, 2007). "Would he still be King?". ''Radio Times''. BBC, p.12</ref>

"That's All Right" was aired on July 8, 1954, by [[DJ]] [[Dewey Phillips]].<ref name=Carr-6>Carr and Farren, p.6</ref>{{fn|b}} Listeners to the show began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was.<ref name="Clutton"/> (The DJ mispronounced Presley's apparently unusual name as "Elton Preston.")<ref name=Clayton-58>Clayton and Heard, p.58</ref> The interest was such that Phillips played the demo fourteen times.<ref name="Clutton"/> During an interview on the show, Phillips asked Presley what high school he attended&mdash;to clarify Presley's color for listeners who assumed he must be black.<ref name="Clutton"/> The first release of Presley's music featured "That's All Right" and "Blue Moon of Kentucky". With Presley's version of Monroe's song consistently rated higher,
both sides began to chart across the South.<ref>EPE (July 21, 2004). "[http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/elvis_presley_sun_recordings.shtml Elvis Presley Sun Recordings]". ''elvis.co.au''. Retrieved on August 17, 2007.</ref>

Moore and Black began playing regularly with Presley.

Deejay and promoter Bob Neal became the trio's manager (replacing Scotty Moore). Moore and Black left their band, the Starlight Wranglers and, from August through October 1954, appeared with Presley at The Eagle's Nest.<ref name=EarlyGigs /> Presley debuted at the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] on October 2; Hank Snow introduced Presley on stage. He performed "Blue Moon of Kentucky" but received only a polite response. Afterwards, the singer was supposedly told by the Opry's Jim Denny: "Boy, you’d better keep driving that truck,"<ref name=Naylor-43>Naylor and Halliday, pp.43-6</ref> though others deny it was Denny who made that statement.<ref name=Clayton-69>Clayton and Heard, p.69</ref>
Country music promoter and manager [[Tillman Franks]] booked Presley for October 16 on [[KWKH|KWKH-AM]]'s ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''. Before Franks saw Presley, he referred to him as "that new black singer with the funny name".<ref>Naylor and Halliday, p.46</ref> During Presley's first set, the reaction was muted; Franks then advised Presley to "Let it all go!" for the second set. House drummer [[D.J. Fontana]] (who had worked in strip clubs) complemented Presley's movements with accented beats. Bill Black also took an active part in encouraging the audience, and the crowd became more responsive.<ref>Naylor and Halliday, p.52</ref><ref name=Clayton-73>Clayton and Heard, p.73</ref>

According to one source, regarding Presley's engagements from that time, "Audiences had never before heard [such] music... [or] seen anyone who performed like Presley either. The shy, polite, mumbling boy gained self-confidence with every appearance... People watching the show were astounded and shocked, both by the ferocity of his performance, and the crowd’s reaction to it... [[Roy Orbison]] saw Presley for the first time in Odessa, Texas: 'His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing... I just didn’t know what to make of it.

By August 1955, Sun Studios had released ten sides, credited to "Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill," all typical of the developing Presley style which seemed hard to categorize; he was billed or labeled in the media as "The King of Western Bop," "The [[Hillbilly#Music|Hillbilly]] Cat" and "The Memphis Flash."<ref name=Hopkins-53>Hopkins 2007, p.53</ref>

On January 10, Presley made his first recordings for RCA in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="autogenerated2">Stanley and Coffey, p.30</ref> The session produced "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]/I Was The One" which was released on January 27. The public reaction to "Heartbreak Hotel" prompted RCA to release it as a single in its own right (February 11).<ref name="autogenerated2" /> By April it had hit number one in the U.S. charts, selling in excess of one million copies.

On March 3, 1955, Presley made his first television appearance on the TV version of ''Louisiana Hayride'' on [[KSLA-TV]], but failed an audition for ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' on [[CBS|CBS-TV]] later that month. To increase the singer's exposure, Parker finally brought Presley to national television after booking six appearances on CBS's ''[[Stage Show (TV series)|Stage Show]]'' in New York, beginning January 28, 1956. Presley was introduced on the first program by [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] DJ [[Bill Randle]]. He stayed in town and on January 30, he and the band headed for the RCA's New York Studio.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> The sessions yielded eight songs, including "My Baby Left Me" and "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]". The latter was the only hit single from the collection, but the recordings marked the point at which Presley started moving away from the raw, pure Sun sound to the more commercial and mainstream sound RCA had envisioned for him.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

On March 23, RCA Victor released ''[[Elvis Presley (album)|Elvis Presley]]'', his first album. Like the Sun recordings, the majority of the tracks were country songs.<ref>Hilburn, Robert (2005-02-11).

On April 1, Presley launched his acting career with a screen test for [[Paramount Pictures]]. His first motion picture, ''[[Love Me Tender (1956 film)|Love Me Tender]]'', was released on November 21 (See '[[#Acting career|Acting career]]').

Parker had also obtained a deal for two lucrative appearances on [[NBC|NBC-TV's]] ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]''.  Presley first appeared from the deck of the ''[[USS Hancock (CV-19)|USS Hancock]]'' in [[San Diego]] on April 3. His performance was cheered by a live audience of appreciative sailors and their dates.<ref name="autogenerated6">Jorgensen, p.45</ref> A few days after, a flight taking Presley's band to Nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken (the plane lost an engine and almost went down over Texas).<ref name="autogenerated6" />

From April 23, Presley was scheduled to perform four weeks at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]&mdash;billed this time as "the Atomic Powered Singer" (since [[Nevada]] was the home of the U.S.'s [[Nuclear weapons testing|atomic weapons testing]], Parker thought the name would be catchy). His shows were so badly received by critics and the conservative, middle-aged guests, that Parker cut short the engagement from four weeks to two.<ref name=Stanley-32>Stanley and Coffey, p.32</ref> D.J. Fontana said, "I don't think the people there were ready for Elvis..... We tried everything we knew. Usually Elvis could get them on his side. It didn't work that time". While in Vegas, Presley saw [[Freddie Bell and the Bellboys]] live, and liked their version of [[Leiber and Stoller]]'s "[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]". By May 16, he had added the song to his own act.<ref>Butler, Peter. "[http://www.rockabillyhall.com/BillBlack1.html Blackie]". ''RockabillyHall.com''. Retrieved on 2007-10-14.</ref>

After more hectic touring, Presley made his second appearance on ''The Milton Berle Show'' (June 5). Whilst delivering an uptempo version of "Hound Dog" (without his guitar), he then stopped, and immediately after began performing a slower version.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5JALwwaASg See complete Milton Berle Show Hound Dog footage with original music.]</ref> Presley's "gyrations" during this televised version of "Hound Dog" created a storm of controversy&mdash;even eclipsing the "[[communist]] threat" headlines prevalent at the time.<ref name="Jorgensen-49">Jorgensen, p.49</ref> The press described his performance as "vulgar" and "obscene".<ref name="Jorgensen-49"/><ref>An example of press criticism can be found at Gould, Jack (June 6, 1956).

That's what happens to me. I have to move around. I can't stand still. I've tried it, and I can't do it."<ref name=Elvis56 /> After this performance he was dubbed "Elvis the Pelvis". Presley disliked the name, calling it "one of the most childish expressions I ever heard."<ref name=Farren-89>Farren and Marchbank, p.89</ref>

The Berle shows drew such huge ratings that [[Steve Allen]] ([[NBC]]), not a fan of rock and roll, booked him for one appearance in New York on July 1. Allen wanted "to do a show the whole family can watch" and introduced a "new Elvis" in white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang "Hound Dog" for less than a minute to a [[Basset Hound]] in a [[top hat]]. According to one author, "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd... [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition..."<ref>Austen, p.13</ref><ref name=Beebe>Beebe, Fulbrook and Saunders, p.97</ref> In his book "Hi-Ho Steverino!"

Country vocalists [[The Jordanaires]] accompanied Presley on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' and their first recording session together produced "[[Any Way You Want Me]]", "[[Don't Be Cruel]]" and "Hound Dog". The Jordanaires would work with the singer through the 1960s.

Though Presley had been unhappy, Allen's show had, for the first time, beaten ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in the ratings, causing a critical Sullivan ([[CBS]]) to book Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.<ref>For more on the TV host rivalries of the period, see "[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/steveallens/steveallens.htm The Steve Allen Show (And Various Related Programs)]".

=== Controversy and cultural impact ===
{{main|Cultural impact of Elvis Presley}}
When "That's All Right" was played, many listeners were sure Presley must be black, prompting white disc-jockeys to ignore his Sun singles. However, black disc-jockeys did not want anything to do with any record they knew was made by a white man.<ref>Carr and Farren, pp.11, 16</ref> To many black adults, Presley had undoubtedly "stolen" or at least "derived his style from the Negro rhythm-and-blues performers of the late 1940s",<ref>Bayles, p.22</ref> though such criticism ignored Presley's use of "white" musical styles. Some black entertainers, notably [[Jackie Wilson]], argued: "A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man’s music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis."<ref name=Blank>Blank, Christopher (July 15, 2006).

By the spring of 1956, Presley was becoming popular nationwide and teenagers flocked to his concerts. Scotty Moore recalled: "He’d start out, 'You ain’t nothin’ but a Hound Dog,' and they’d just go to pieces. They’d always react the same way. There’d be a riot every time."<ref>Moore and Dickerson, p.175</ref> Bob Neal wrote: "It was almost frightening, the reaction... from [white] teenage boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him." In [[Lubbock, Texas]], a teenage gang fire-bombed Presley's car.<ref name = "lwlcmi">Carr and Farren, p.12</ref> Some performers became resentful (or resigned to the fact) that Presley's unmatched hustle onstage before them would "kill" their own act; he thus rose quickly to top billing.<ref name = "lwlcmi"/> At the two concerts he performed at the 1956 Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, fifty [[United States National Guard|National Guardsmen]] were added to the police security to prevent crowd trouble.<ref>Guralnick 1994, p.343</ref>

To many white adults, the singer was "the first rock symbol of teenage rebellion. ... they did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-[[Negro]] prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex."<ref>Billboard writer Arnold Shaw, cited in Denisoff, p.22.</ref> In 1956, a critic for the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' wrote that popular music "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley" and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] denounced him in their weekly magazine, ''[[America (magazine)|America]]''.<ref>"[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/music/elvis.html Elvis Presley - 1956]".

"[http://quotations.about.com/od/stillmorefamouspeople/a/elvispresley3.htm Quotes About Elvis Presley]". ''about.com''. Retrieved on 2007-10-14.</ref> Presley responded to this (and other derogatory comments Sinatra made) by saying: "I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it... This ... [rock and roll] ... is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago."<ref name=Hopkins126>Hopkins, p.126</ref>

According to the FBI files on the singer, Presley was even seen as a "definite danger to the security of the United States." His actions and motions were called "a [[Striptease|strip-tease]] with clothes on" or "sexual self-gratification on stage." They were compared with "[[masturbation]] or riding a microphone." Some saw the singer as a sexual [[perversion|pervert]], and psychologists feared that teenaged girls and boys could easily be "aroused to sexual indulgence and perversion by certain types of motions and [[hysteria]]—the type that was exhibited at the Presley show."<ref>See Fensch, Thomas. ''The FBI Files on Elvis Presley'', pp.15-17.</ref> Presley would insist, however, that there was nothing vulgar about his stage act, saying: "Some people tap their feet, some people snap their fingers, and some people sway back and forth. I just sorta do ‘em all together, I guess."<ref>[http://www.quotesandsayings.com/gelvispresley.htm Elvis Quotes]</ref> In August 1956, a [[Florida]] judge called Presley a "savage" and threatened to arrest him if he shook his body while performing in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]. The judge declared that Presley's music was undermining the youth of America. Throughout the performance (which was filmed by police), he kept still as ordered, except for wiggling a finger in mockery at the ruling.<ref name=Marino>Marino, Rick.

An African American journalist at ''[[Jet magazine|Jet]]'' magazine subsequently pursued the story. On the set of ''[[Jailhouse Rock (1957 film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'', Presley denied saying, or ever wanting to make, such a racist remark. The ''Jet'' journalist found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, but did find testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.<ref>See [http://www.ferris.edu/JIMCROW/question/mar06/ Question of the Month: Elvis Presley and Racism] Retrieved on [[2007-10-14]].</ref> Despite the remark being wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later.<ref>See: Kolawole, Helen (August 15, 2002).

His parents moved home in Memphis, but the singer lived there briefly. With increased concerns over privacy and security, [[Graceland]] was bought and renovated in 1957, a mansion with several acres of land. This was Presley's primary residence until his death.

Presley's record sales grew quickly throughout the late 1950s, with hits like "[[All Shook Up]]", "[[Teddy Bear (song)|(Let me Be Your) Teddy Bear]]" and "[[Too Much (Elvis Presley song)|Too Much]]".

On December 20, 1957, Presley received his [[Conscription in the United States|draft notice]].

Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier, despite his fame, and to his generosity while in the service. To supplement meager under-clothing supplies, Presley bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit. He also donated his Army pay to charity, and purchased all the TV sets for personnel on the base at that time.<ref name=Clayton-160>Clayton and Heard, p.160</ref>

Presley had chosen not to join "Special Services", which would have allowed him to avoid certain duties and maintain his public profile.<ref>Lichter, p.51</ref> He continued to receive massive media coverage, with much speculation echoing Presley's own concerns about his enforced absence damaging his career. However, early in 1958, RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range (Presley's main music publishers) had both pushed for recording sessions and strong song material, the aim being to release regular hit recordings during Presley's two-year hiatus.<ref>Jorgensen, p.107</ref> Hit singles duly followed during Presley's army service, like "[[One Night]]", "[[I Got Stung]]" and "[[(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I]]", as did hit albums of old material, including ''Elvis' Golden Records'' and ''A Date With Elvis''.

As Presley's fame grew, his mother continued to drink excessively and began to gain weight. She had wanted her son to succeed, "but...

Some months later, in Germany, "[a] sergeant had introduced [Presley] to [[amphetamines]] when they were on maneuvers at [[Grafenwöhr]]... it seemed like half the guys in the company were taking them." Friends around Presley, like [[Diamond Joe Esposito]], also began taking them, "if only to keep up with Elvis, who was practically [[Evangelism|evangelical]] about their benefits."<ref name="autogenerated7" /> The Army also introduced Presley to [[karate]]&mdash;something which he studied seriously, even including it in his later live performances.<ref>Guralnick 1994, p.71</ref>{{fn|d}}

It was as if Elvis had... broken down the barriers of genre and prejudice to express everything he heard in all the kinds of music he loved".<ref>Jorgensen, p.128</ref> The album was also notable because of Homer [[Boots Randolph]]'s acclaimed saxophone playing on the blues songs "[[Like A Baby]]" and "[[Reconsider Baby]]", the latter being described as "a refutation of those who do not recognize what a phenomenal artist Presley was."<ref name=Matthew-Walker-49 />

In 1956, Presley launched his career as a film actor.

After signing a seven-year contract with Paramount, Presley made his big-screen début with the musical western, ''[[Love Me Tender (1956 film)|Love Me Tender]]''. It was panned by the critics but did well at the box office.<ref>Harbinson, p.62</ref>
The original title&mdash;''The [[Reno Brothers]]''&mdash;was changed to capitalize on the advanced sales of the song "Love Me Tender". The majority of Presley's films were musical comedies made to "sell records and produce high revenues."<ref>Falk and Falk, p.52</ref> He also appeared in more dramatic films, like ''[[Jailhouse Rock (1957 film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'' and ''[[King Creole]]''.

In the Army, Presley had said on many occasions that "more than anything, he wanted to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor."<ref>Guralnick 1999, p.50</ref> His manager had negotiated the multi-picture seven-year contract with [[Hal Wallis]] with an eye on long-term earnings.<ref>Guralnick 1999, p.27</ref> The singer would later star alongside several established or up-and-coming actors, including [[Walter Matthau]], [[Carolyn Jones]], [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], [[Mary Tyler Moore]]&mdash;and even a very young [[Kurt Russell]] in his screen debut. Although Presley was praised by directors, like [[Michael Curtiz]], as polite and hardworking (and as having an exceptional memory), "he was definitely not the most talented actor around."<ref>Verswijver, p.129</ref> Others were more charitable; critic [[Bosley Crowther]] of the ''New York Times'' said: "This boy can act," about his portrayal in ''King Creole''. Director [[Joe Pasternak]] believed "Elvis should be given more meaty parts. ... He would be a good actor. He should do more important pictures."<ref name=Hopkins-185>Hopkins 2007, p.185</ref>

Presley's movies were generally poorly received, with one critic dismissing them as a "pantheon of bad taste."<ref>Caine, p.21</ref> The scripts of his movies "were all the same, the songs progressively worse."<ref>Kirchberg and Hendricks, p.67</ref> For ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'', "fourteen songs were cut in just three days."<ref>Hopkins, p.31</ref> Julie Parrish, who appeared in ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]'', says that Presley hated many of the songs chosen for his films; he "couldn't stop laughing while he was recording" one of them.<ref>Lisanti 2000, pp.19, 136</ref> Others noted that the songs seemed to be "written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll."<ref>Hopkins, p.32</ref> ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' wrote that in his movies "Elvis Presley, aggressively [[bisexual]] in appeal, knowingly [[eroticism|erotic]], [was] acting like a [[crucifixion|crucified]] [[houri]] and singing with a kind of machine-made [[surrealism]]."<ref>''Sight and Sound'', The British Film Institute, British Institute of Adult Education (1992), p.30.</ref>  However, several reputable songwriters/partnerships contributed soundtrack songs, including [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]], [[Don Robertson (songwriter)|Don Robertson]], [[Sid Tepper]] and [[Roy C. Bennett]], and [[Otis Blackwell]] and [[Winfield Scott (songwriter)|Winfield Scott]]. Whatever the quality of the material, some observers have argued that Presley generally sang well in the studio, with commitment, and always played with distinguished musicians and backing singers.<ref>Matthew-Walker 1979, p.66</ref> Despite this, critics maintained that "No major star suffered through more bad movies than Elvis Presley."<ref>Lyon, p.511</ref>

[[File:ElvisVivaLasVegas.jpg|thumb|left|Elvis in the film ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' (1964)]]
Presley movies were nevertheless very popular, and he "became a film genre of his own."<ref>Lisanti 2000, p.18</ref> Hal Wallis would later remark: "An Elvis Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood."<ref>[http://www.elvispresley.com.au/ Elvis Presley Movie Facts] Retrieved on 2008-07-30</ref> Elvis on celluloid was the only chance for his worldwide fans to see him, in the absence of live appearances (the only time he toured outside of the U.S. was in Canada in 1957).{{fn|e}} His ''Blue Hawaii'' even "boosted the new state's tourism. Some of his most enduring and popular songs came from those [kind of] movies," like "[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]," "[[Return to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]" and "[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]."<ref>Hopkins, vii</ref> His 1960s films and soundtracks grossed some $280 million.<ref>Alagna, ''Elvis Presley''</ref> On December 1, 1968, the ''New York Times'' wrote: "Three times a year Elvis Presley ... [makes] multimillion-dollar feature-length films, with holiday titles like ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'', ''[[Fun in Acapulco]]'', ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Tickle Me]]'', ''[[Easy Come, Easy Go (film)|Easy Come, Easy Go]]'', ''[[Live a Little, Love a Little]]'' and ''[[The Trouble With Girls]]''. For each film, Elvis receives a million dollars in wages and 50 per cent of the profits. ... [E]very film yields an LP sound-track record which may sell as many as two-million copies."

In 1964, [[Richard Burton]] and [[Peter O'Toole]] had starred in Hal Wallis' acclaimed ''[[Becket (film)|Becket]]''. Wallis admitted to the press that the financing of such quality productions was only possible by making a series of profitable B-movies starring Presley. Elvis branded Wallis "a double-dealing sonofabitch" (and he thought little better of Tom Parker), realizing there had never been any intention to let him develop into a serious actor.<ref name = "pefciv">Guralnick 1999, p.171</ref>

Presley was similarly exploited the following year with the film ''[[Tickle Me]]''. [[Allied Artists]] had serious financial problems and hoped a Presley film would help them "stay afloat".<ref name=Tickle-Me>[http://www.elvispresley.com.au/elvis/presley/tickle_me.shtml Behind the Scenes of ''Tickle Me'']</ref> By agreeing to a lower fee, using previously recorded songs and filming on the studio back-lot, Allied Artists were able to keep costs very low.<ref name=Tickle-Me/> Considered one of the weakest of all Presley pictures, it became the third highest grossing picture in Allied Artists' history, and saved them from bankruptcy at the time.<ref name=Tickle-Me/>

By the late sixties, the [[Hippie]] movement had developed and musical acts like [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[The Doors]] and [[Janis Joplin]] were dominating the airwaves.<ref>Lisanti 2000, p.9</ref> [[Priscilla Presley]] recalls: "He blamed his fading popularity on his humdrum movies" and "... loathed their stock plots and short shooting schedules." She also notes: "He could have demanded better, more substantial scripts, but he didn't."<ref>Presley, p.188</ref>

''[[Change of Habit]]'' (1969) was the singer's final movie role. His last two films were concert documentaries in the early 1970s, though Presley was keen to consider dramatic movie roles.<ref name=George-Warren>George-Warren, Romanowski and Pareles, ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock And Roll''. Excerpt in "[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/elvispresley/biography Elvis Presley biography]". ''Rolling Stone''. Retrieved on 2007-10-14.</ref> (See: '[[#Influence of Colonel Parker and others|Influence of Colonel Parker and others]]').

As well as the formulaic movie songs of the 1960s, Presley added to the studio recordings of ''Elvis Is Back'', by recording other noteworthy songs like "[[She's Not You]]", "[[Suspicion (Pomus/Shuman song)|Suspicion]]," "[[Little Sister (Pomus/Shuman song)|Little Sister]]", "[[(You're the) Devil in Disguise]]" and "[[It Hurts Me]]." In 1966 he recorded a cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Tomorrow is a Long Time]]" (which RCA Victor relegated to a bonus track on the soundtrack album for ''[[Spinout]]''). He also produced two gospel albums: ''[[His Hand in Mine]]'' (1960) and ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1966). In 1967, he recorded some well-received singles, like [[Guitar Man]], by songwriter/guitar player [[Jerry Reed]]. However, "during the Beatles era (1963-70), only six Elvis singles reached number ten or better. 'Suspicious Minds' was the lone number one."<ref>Kirchberg, Connie and Marc Hendricks 1999, p.66.</ref>

=== Marriage to Priscilla ===
{{main|Priscilla Presley|Elvis and Me|Lisa Marie Presley}}

Elvis and Priscilla met in 1959 at a party in [[Bad Nauheim|Bad Nauheim, Germany]] during his stay in the army.<ref name=Clutton/> She was 14 at the time, while he was 24. They quickly began a romantic relationship and were frequently together until Elvis left Germany in 1960.
In her autobiography, ''[[Elvis and Me]]'', Priscilla says that Elvis refused to have sex with her until they were married. However, biographer [[Suzanne Finstad]] writes that Priscilla and Elvis slept together on their second date, and that she wasn't a virgin when she met him.<ref>Finstad, Suzanne, ''Child Bride: The Untold Story of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley'' (1997).</ref> Priscilla later filed a lawsuit against Currie Grant for his claim in Finstad's book that he had sex with her in exchange for introducing her to Presley and won.  However, neither Finstad nor her publisher was a party to the lawsuit, and Finstad says she stands by the account in her book.

Priscilla and Elvis stayed in contact over the phone, though they would not see each other again until the summer of 1962, when Priscilla's parents agreed to let her visit for two weeks.<ref name=Clutton/><ref>Priscilla, Biography Channel</ref> After another visit at Christmas, Priscilla's parents finally let her move to America for good.<ref name=Clutton/> Part of the agreement was that she would be privately educated, to complete her senior year, and live with Elvis' father and his wife, Dee, in their home&mdash;due to Presley's difficulty with accepting his stepmother, he arranged for them to live in a separate house on the Graceland estate. Priscilla's parents allowed her to live at Graceland only if Elvis promised to eventually marry her.<ref name=Clutton/> However, it wasn't long until Priscilla was moved into Graceland to live with Elvis.<ref name=Clutton/>

Shortly before Christmas 1966, Elvis proposed to Priscilla. They married on May 1, 1967 at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas after an eight-year courtship. In typical fashion, Colonel Parker had arranged a photo session and press conference to be conducted shortly after the ceremony.<ref>[http://elvis.com/elvisology/bio/elvis_1966_1969.asp elvis.com Biography]</ref> According to Finstad, this marriage was part of a mastermind for fame hatched by Priscilla and her mother.

Their only child, [[Lisa Marie Presley|Lisa Marie]], was born on February 1, 1968.

=== Sex symbol ===
{{main|Relationships of Elvis Presley}}
Presley's sexual appeal and photogenic looks have been acknowledged: for example, director [[Steve Binder]], not a fan of Presley's music at the time, recalled from the [[Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special|'68 Comeback Special]] (when Presley was fit and tanned): "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence."<ref name="Binder"/>

According to [[Marjorie Garber]], a "male rock critic writing in 1970 praised Elvis as 'The master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl.' ... rumor had it that into his skin-tight jeans was sewn a lead bar to suggest a weapon of heroic proportions." She cites a boyhood friend of Presley's who claims the singer actually used a cardboard toilet roll tube to make it "look to the girls up front like he had one helluva thing there inside his pants."<ref>Garber, Marjorie, ''Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing & Cultural Anxiety'', p. 382.</ref> Ed Sullivan had apparently heard similar rumors and instructed his director Marlo Lewis to film only Presley's chest and head for his final Sullivan appearance. However, Lewis was skeptical about Presley wearing such a device and says simply: "It wasn't there".<ref name=Clayton-118>Clayton and Heard, p. 118.</ref>

Accounts of Presley's numerous sexual conquests may be exaggerated.<ref>Kirchberg and Hendricks, p. 62.</ref><ref>Curtin, Curtin and Ginter, p. 119.</ref> [[Cybill Shepherd]] reveals that Presley kissed her all over her naked body - but refused to have oral sex with her.<ref>See [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001732/news "Hollywood Actress Reveals Her Elvis Sex Secrets"].

[[Ann-Margret]] (Presley's co-star in ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'') refers to Presley as her "soulmate" but has revealed little else.<ref>Margret, ''Ann-Margret: My Story''</ref> A publicity campaign about Presley and Margret's romance was launched during the filming of ''Viva Las Vegas'',<ref>Presley, p. 175.</ref> which helped to increase Margret's popularity.<ref name=Gamson-46>Gamson, p. 46.</ref><ref>Harrington and Bielby, p. 273.</ref> Presley apparently dated many female co-stars for publicity purposes.<ref>Stein, Ruthe (August 3, 1997).

=== "The Fab Four" meet "The King" ===
During filming of ''Paradise, Hawaiian Style'', Presley returned to his [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]] home. [[The Beatles]] were at the end of their second U.S. tour. Colonel Parker had been negotiating a meeting for some time, through The Beatles' manager [[Brian Epstein]], though Parker simply saw it as a valuable publicity opportunity (he had apparently even tried to get the group and Presley to perform the closing song in the same movie, but The Beatles' film contract precluded it{{Fact|date=June 2009}}). The group arrived in Bel Air amid a flurry of elaborate security arrangements made by Parker at 10pm, on August 27, 1965.<ref name=Guralnick-1999-211>Guralnick 1999, p.211</ref> The visit lasted about four hours. Many of Presley's closest and trusted friends&mdash; members of the so-called "[[Memphis Mafia]]"&mdash;were present, including school friend and bodyguard Red West, Marty Lacker, [[Jerry Schilling]], Larry Geller and their girlfriends.<ref name=Guralnick-1999-211/>

Biographer Peter Guralnick maintains that Presley was at best "lukewarm" about playing host to people he did not really know, and it took a while for everyone to feel comfortable.<ref name=Guralnick-1999-211/> [[Paul McCartney]] later said: "It was one of the great meetings of my life. I think he liked us. I think at that time, he may have felt a little bit threatened, but he didn't say anything. We certainly didn't feel any antagonism. I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."<ref name="elvispresleynews1">[http://www.elvispresleynews.com/Beatles.html Elvis Presley News]</ref>

Marty Lacker recalls Presley saying: "'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."<ref name="Memphis1">Nash, Smith, Lacker and Fike ''Elvis and the Memphis Mafia'', p359-360</ref> The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session.<ref name="elvispresleynews1"/> "They all went to the piano," says Lacker, "and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs, [[Chuck Berry]] songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "[[I Feel Fine]]", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"<ref name="Memphis1"/>

[[Ringo Starr]] played pool with two others that night; [[George Harrison]] "looked to most of the guys to be stoned" on arrival and allegedly smoked a joint with Larry Geller and talked about [[Hinduism]] (see: '[[#Influence of Colonel Parker and others|Influence of Colonel Parker and others]]'). Parker played roulette with Epstein.<ref name=Guralnick-1999-211/> However, Guralnick claims The Beatles were, overall, disappointed by the visit. They still reciprocated with an invitation for Elvis to visit them, but only some of Presley's "Memphis Mafia" accepted. "[[John Lennon]] went out of his way to tell Jerry [Schilling] how much the evening had meant to him" and asked Schilling to tell Presley, "'[I]f it hadn't been for him I would have been nothing.'" Schilling says that when he told Presley he did not say anything, but "just kind of smiled."<ref>Guralnick 1999, p.212</ref>
(See: '[[#1970–1972|1970–1972)]]').

=== Influence of Colonel Parker and others ===
{{main|Colonel Tom Parker|Memphis Mafia}}
By 1967, Colonel Tom Parker had negotiated a contract that gave him 50% of Presley's earnings. Parker's excessive gambling&mdash;and his subsequent need to have Presley signed up to commercially lucrative contracts&mdash;may well have adversely affected the course of Presley's career.<ref>http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2002/08/18/story343531628.asp. Retrieved on 2008-07-30.</ref> Parker's concerns about his own U.S. citizenship (he was a Dutch immigrant) may have also been a factor in Parker and the singer never exploiting Presley's popularity abroad (see: '[[#1973–1976|1973–1976]]'). It has been claimed that Presley's original band was fired in order to isolate the singer: Parker wanted no one close to Presley to suggest that a better management deal might exist.<ref>Dickerson, ''Colonel Tom Parker: The Curious Life of Elvis Presley's Eccentric Manager''</ref>

As well as signing Presley to RCA Victor, Parker also cut a deal with Hill and Range Publishing Company to create a separate entity&mdash; "Elvis Presley Music Incorporated"&mdash;to handle all of Presley's songs and accrued royalties. Parker would later use this set-up to make songwriters relinquish some of their royalties; this ultimately resulted in the better writers refusing to provide songs for Presley, causing a marked decline in the quality of his output over the years.<ref name="autogenerated3" />
Presley apparently disliked several songs&mdash;even some of the earliest top sellers he became famous for (which suggests commercial influences were sometimes greater than his own desires). Presley's friend Jerry Schilling relates that one way to really annoy the singer was to play a song, like "All Shook Up", on a jukebox at one of his private parties. "Get that crap off," was his typical reaction.<ref name=Schilling>Schilling, Jerry (2006-07-10). "[http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/books/book_me_and_a_guy_named_elvis2.shtml Why I Wrote Me And A Guy Named Elvis]". ''elvis.com.au''. Retrieved on 2007-10-23.</ref>

In 1969, record producer [[Chips Moman]] and Presley recorded with Moman's own musicians at his American Sound Studios in Memphis. Given the control exerted by RCA and the music publishers, this was a significant departure. Moman still had to deal with Hill and Range staff on site and was not happy with their song choices. Moman could only get the best out of the singer when he threatened to quit the sessions and asked Presley to remove the "aggravating" publishing personnel from the studio.<ref>Clayton and Heard, p.264-5</ref> RCA Victor executive Joan Deary was later full of praise for the song choices and superior results of Moman's work, like "[[In the Ghetto]]" and "[[Suspicious Minds]]", but despite this, no producer was to override Hill and Range's control again.<ref>Clayton and Heard, p.267</ref>

According to life-long friend and "[[Memphis Mafia]]" member George Klein, over the years Presley was offered lead roles in the film ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' and in ''[[West Side Story]]''. [[Robert Mitchum]] personally offered him the lead in ''[[Thunder Road]]''.<ref name=Clayton-226>Clayton and Heard, p.226</ref> In 1974, [[Barbra Streisand]] approached Presley to star with her in the remake of ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star is Born]]''. In each case, any ambitions the singer may have had to play such parts were thwarted by his manager's negotiating demands, or his flat refusals.<ref name=George-Warren/>

Marty Lacker regarded Parker as a "hustler and scam artist" who abused Presley's trust, but Lacker acknowledged that Parker was a master promoter.<ref>Nash, Lacker, Fike and Smith, ''Elvis Aron Presley: Revelations from the Memphis Mafia''</ref> Priscilla Presley noted that "Elvis detested the business side of his career. He would sign a contract without even reading it."<ref>Presley, ''Elvis and Me''</ref>

Presley's father in turn distrusted Lacker and the other members of the "Memphis Mafia"; he thought they collectively exercised an unhealthy influence over his son.<ref>Humphries, p.79</ref> "[I]t was no wonder" that as the singer "slid into addiction and torpor, no one raised the alarm: to them, Elvis was the bank, and it had to remain open."<ref>Harris, John (March 27, 2006). "Talking about Graceland". ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref> Musician Tony Brown noted the urgent need to reverse Presley's declining health as the singer toured in the mid-1970s. "But we all knew it was hopeless because Elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people... all those so-called friends and... bodyguards."<ref>Clayton and Heard, p.339</ref> In the "Memphis Mafia"'s defence, Marty Lacker has said: "[Presley] was his own man. ... If we hadn't been around, he would have been dead a lot earlier."<ref name=Connolly-148>Connolly 2007, p.148</ref>

Larry Geller became Presley's hairdresser in 1964. Unlike others in the "Memphis Mafia", Geller was interested in 'spiritual studies', and was subsequently viewed with suspicion and scorn by the singer's manager and friends.<ref name=Guralnick-1999-173>Guralnick 1999, p.173</ref> From their first conversation, Geller recalls how Presley revealed his secret thoughts and anxieties, how "there's got to be a reason... why I was chosen to be Elvis Presley.'"<ref name=Guralnick-1999-173/> He then poured out his heart in "an almost painful rush of words and emotions," telling Geller about his mother and the hollowness of his Hollywood life, things he could not share with anyone around him. Thereafter, Presley voraciously read books Geller supplied, on religion and mysticism. Perhaps most tellingly, he revealed to Geller: "I swear to God, no one knows how lonely I get and how empty I really feel."<ref>Guralnick 1999, p.174 and in passim</ref> Presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life, taking trunkloads of books with him on tour.<ref name=DrFeelgood/>

=== 1968 comeback ===
{{main|Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special}}
[[File:ElvisPresley-OneNight.jpg|thumb|150 px|Elvis Presley in his [[Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special|'68 Comeback Special]], airing on [[NBC]], December 3, 1968]]
In 1968, even Presley's version of Jerry Reed's hook-laden "Guitar Man" had failed to enter the U.S. Top 40. He continued to issue movie soundtrack albums that sold poorly compared to those of films like ''Blue Hawaii'' from 1961. It had also been nearly six years since the single "[[Good Luck Charm]]" had topped the [[Billboard Hot 100]].<ref name=Comeback>Kubernick, The Complete '68 Comeback Special Booklet</ref>

Presley was, by now, "profoundly" unhappy with his career.<ref name = "pefciv"/> Colonel Parker's plans once again included television, and he arranged for Presley to appear in his own special. The singer had not been on television since Frank Sinatra's Timex special in May of 1960.<ref name=Comeback/> Parker shrewdly manoeuvred a deal with [[NBC]]'s Tom Sarnoff which included the network's commitment to financing a future Presley feature film&mdash;something that Parker had found increasingly difficult to secure.<ref name=Comeback/>

The special was made in June, but was first aired on December 3, 1968 as a Christmas telecast called simply ''Elvis''. Later dubbed the '''68 Comeback Special'' by fans and critics, the show featured some lavishly staged studio productions. Other songs however, were performed live with a band in front of a small audience&mdash;Presley's first live appearance as a performer since 1961. The live segments saw Presley clad in black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style&mdash;reminiscent of his rock and roll days. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it "a performance of emotional grandeur and historical resonance."<ref name="RS"/> Jon Landau in ''Eye'' magazine remarked: "There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made [[Jim Morrison]] green with envy."<ref name=Hopkins-215>Hopkins 2007, p.215</ref> Its success was helped by director and co-producer, Steve Binder, who worked hard to reassure the nervous singer<ref name="Binder">Binder, Steve (2005-07-08). "[http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/interview_steve_binder.shtml Interview with Steve Binder, director of Elvis' 68 Comeback Special]". ''elvis.com.au''.

"Comeback Special". ''[[BBC]] Radio Two''.</ref>

By January, 1969, one of the key songs written specifically for the special, "[[If I Can Dream]]", reached number 12.<ref name=Comeback/> The soundtrack of the special also broke into the Top 10. On December 4, when the TV ratings were released, NBC reported that Presley had captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. It was the network's number one rated show that season.<ref name=Comeback/>

Jerry Schilling recalls that the special reminded Presley about what "he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack. ... He was out of prison, man." Steve Binder said of Presley's reaction: "I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, "Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I don't believe in."<ref name=Comeback/>

Buoyed by the experience, Presley engaged in the prolific series of recording sessions at American Sound Studios, which led to the acclaimed ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]'' (Chips Moman was its uncredited producer).<ref>Jorgensen, p.281</ref> It was followed by ''[[From Memphis To Vegas/From Vegas To Memphis]]'', a double-album. The same sessions lead to the hit singles "In the Ghetto", "Suspicious Minds", "[[Kentucky Rain]]" and "[[Don't Cry Daddy]]".

=== Return to live performances ===
In 1969, Presley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of ''Elvis'', many new offers came in from around the world.<ref name=Vegas1>The King on The Road, Elvis Presley Enterprises</ref> The [[London Palladium]] offered Parker $28,000 for a one week engagement. He responded: "That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?"<ref name=Vegas1/> By May, the brand new [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] announced that it had booked Presley; he was scheduled to perform from July 31, after [[Barbra Streisand]] opened the new venue.<ref name=Vegas1/>

Presley duly delivered fifty-seven shows over four weeks at the hotel, which had the largest showroom in the city. He had assembled some of the finest musicians&mdash;including an orchestra&mdash;and some of the best [[Soul music|soul]]/gospel back-up singers available.<ref name=Vegas1/>

Despite such a prestigious backing, Presley was nervous; his only other engagement in Las Vegas (1956) had been a disaster, critically. Parker therefore promoted the singer's appearances heavily; he rented billboards and took out full-page advertisements in local and trade papers. The lobby of the International displayed Presley souvenirs; records, T-shirts, straw boaters and stuffed animals. Parker intended to make Presley's return the [[show business]] event of the year, and hotel owner [[Kirk Kerkorian]] planned to send his own plane to New York to fly in the rock press for the debut performance.<ref name=Vegas1/>

Presley took to the stage with no introduction. The audience&mdash;which included [[Pat Boone]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Dick Clark]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]], [[Angie Dickinson]], and [[Henry Mancini]]&mdash;gave him a standing ovation before he sang one note.<ref name=Vegas1/> After a well-received performance, he returned to give an encore, of "Can't Help Falling in Love", and was given his third standing ovation<ref name=Vegas1/> Backstage, many well-wishers, including [[Cary Grant]], congratulated Presley on his triumphant return which, in the showroom alone, had generated over $1,500,000.<ref name=Vegas1/>

''[[Newsweek]]'' commented: "There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars."<ref>[http://www.elvispeople.com/share.php Elvis Quotes]</ref> Rolling Stone magazine declared Presley to be "supernatural, his own resurrection", while [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] proclaimed him a "superstar".<ref name=Clutton/> At a press conference after his opening show, when a reporter referred to him as "The King", Presley pointed to [[Fats Domino]], standing at the back of the room.

=== 1970–1972 ===
[[File:Elvis-nixon.jpg|thumb|left|Elvis meets [[U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[White House]] [[Oval Office]], December 21, 1970]]

In January 1970, Presley returned to the International Hotel for a month-long engagement, performing two shows a night. RCA recorded some shows and the best material appeared on the album [[On Stage: February 1970|''On Stage - February 1970'']].<ref name=Stanley-94>Stanley and Coffey, p.94</ref> In late February, Presley performed six more attendance-breaking shows at the [[Houston Astrodome]] in [[Texas]].<ref name=Stanley-95>Stanley and Coffey, p.95</ref>
In August at the International Hotel, MGM filmed rehearsal and concert footage for a documentary: [[Elvis: That's the Way It Is|''Elvis - That's The Way It Is'']]. He wore a jumpsuit&mdash;a garment that would become a trademark of Presley's live performances in the 1970s. Although he had new hit singles in many countries, some were critical of his song choices and accused him of being distant from trends within contemporary music.<ref>(Aired: August 7, 2002). "How Big Was The King? Elvis Presley's Legacy, 25 Years After His Death." ''CBS News''.</ref>

Around this time Presley was threatened with kidnapping at the International Hotel. Phone calls were received, one demanding $50,000; if unpaid, Presley would be killed by a "crazy man". The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] took the threat seriously and security was stepped up for the next two shows. Presley went on stage with a [[Derringer]] in his right boot and a .45 in his waistband, but nothing untoward transpired.<ref name=Hopkins-254>Hopkins 2007, p.254</ref><ref name=Stanley-96>Stanley and Coffey, p.96</ref> (The singer had had many threats of varying degrees since the fifties, many of them made without the singer's knowledge).<ref name=Hopkins-253>Hopkins 2007, p.253</ref>

After closing his Las Vegas engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on his first concert tour since 1958. Feeling exhausted, Presley spent a month relaxing and recording before touring again in October and November.<ref name=Stanley-99>Stanley and Coffey, p.99</ref> He would tour extensively in the U.S. up to his death; many of the 1,145 concerts setting attendance records.

On December 21, 1970, Presley met with President [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[White House]] (Presley arrived with a gift&mdash;a handgun. It was accepted but not presented for security reasons). Presley had engineered the encounter to express his patriotism, his contempt for the [[hippie]] [[drug culture]] and his wish to be appointed a "Federal Agent at Large". He also wished to obtain a [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] badge to add to similar items he had begun collecting. He offered to "infiltrate hippie groups" and claimed that [[The Beatles]] had "made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."<ref name="Guralnick-420">Guralnick 1999, p.420</ref> Nixon was uncertain and bemused by their encounter, and twice expressed his concern to Presley that the singer needed to "retain his credibility".<ref name="Guralnick-420"/><ref name="Guralnick-passim">Guralnick 1999, in passim</ref> Ringo Starr later said he found it very sad to think Presley held such views. "This is Mr. Hips, ''the man'', and he felt we were a danger. I think that the danger was mainly to him and his career." Paul McCartney said also that he "felt a bit betrayed ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."<ref>Brian Roylance, ''The Beatles Anthology'', 2000, Chronicle Books. p.192

On January 16, 1971 Presley was named 'One of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation' by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce (The Jaycees).<ref name="Presley Seventies Biography">http://www.fiftiesweb.com/elvis-bio-70s.htm Presley Seventies Biography</ref> That summer, the City of Memphis named part of [[U.S. Route 51|Highway 51 South]] "Elvis Presley Boulevard",<ref name="Presley Seventies Biography"/>.

In April 1972, MGM again filmed Presley, this time for ''[[Elvis on Tour]]'', which won a 1972 Golden Globe for Best Documentary. A fourteen-date tour started with an unprecedented four consecutive sold-out shows at [[Madison Square Garden]], New York. RCA taped the shows for a live album. After the tour, Presley released the 1972 single "[[Burning Love]]"&mdash;his last top ten hit in the U.S. charts.

=== Divorce from Priscilla ===
Off stage, Presley had continuing problems. He and Priscilla became increasingly distant due to Elvis being on the road so much. It was widely reported that he had cheated on her both before and after they married. In spite of his own infidelity, Presley was furious that Priscilla was having an affair with a mutual acquaintance&mdash;Mike Stone, a karate instructor she had met in 1971 backstage at one of Presley's concerts.<ref name=Clutton/> It was Presley himself who first suggested Priscilla should take lessons from Stone.<ref name=Clutton/> Once the news of their affair came to his attention, he raged obsessively: "There's too much pain in me... Stone [must] die."<ref>Guralnick 1999, p.489</ref> A bodyguard, [[Red West]], felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided: "Aw hell... Maybe it's a bit heavy..."<ref>Guralnick 1999, p.490</ref>

The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972 after 13 years together. Elvis filed for [[legal separation]] in August 1972, and then filed for divorce in January 1973. In the following months, Priscilla visited Elvis in Las Vegas where she claims that he forced himself upon her in his hotel room and said "This is how a real man makes love to a woman.".<ref>Presley, Priscilla, Elvis & Me'' (19).</ref> They were divorced on October 9, 1973, agreeing to share custody of their daughter.

Following his separation from Priscilla, he lived with [[Linda Thompson (actress)|Linda Thompson]], a songwriter and one-time Memphis [[beauty contest|beauty queen]], from July 1972 until just a few months before his death.<ref name=Hopkins-291>Hopkins 2007, p.291</ref> Following their breakup, he had a relationship with [[Ginger Alden]], who has said that they were engaged.

===1973: Aloha from Hawaii ===
[[File:ElvisPresleyAlohafromHawaii.jpg|thumb|righy|Elvis Presley, in ''[[Aloha From Hawaii]]'' television broadcast via satellite on January 14, 1973]]
{{main|Aloha from Hawaii}}
In January 1973, Presley performed two charity concerts in Hawaii for the [[Kui Lee]] cancer foundation (The singer made many other charitable donations throughout his adult life. He also quietly paid hospital bills, bought cars, homes, supported families, paid off debts, etc., for friends, family and total strangers).<ref>[http://biography.elvis.com.au/ Elvis Presley Biography: Charitable Endeavors] Retrieved 2009-06-12</ref>. The first concert (January 12) was primarily a practice run for the main show which was broadcast live on January 14 (The first show also served as a backup if technical problems affected the live broadcast). The "[[Aloha from Hawaii]]" concert was the world's first live concert satellite broadcast, reaching at least a billion viewers live and a further 500 million on delay. The show's album went to number one and spent a year in the charts.<ref>See "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley#Aloha_From_Hawaii Aloha From Hawaii]"</ref> The album also proved to be Presley's last U.S. Number One album during his lifetime.

=== 1973–1976 ===
After his divorce in 1973, Presley became increasingly unwell, with prescription drugs affecting his health, mood and his stage act. His diet had always been unhealthy, and he now had significant weight problems.<ref name="Cause Of Death">[http://www.elvispresleynews.com/CauseOfDeath.html Cause Of Death], ''ElvisPresleyNews.com''. Retrieved on 2008-10-20.</ref> He overdosed twice on [[barbiturate]]s, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first.<ref name=DrFeelgood>(August 11, 2002).

Retrieved on 2007-10-12.</ref> According to Dr. [[George C. Nichopoulos]], Presley's main physician, the singer was "near death" in November 1973 because of side effects of [[Demerol]] addiction. Nichopoulos notes that the subsequent hospital admission "was crazy", because of the enormous attention Presley attracted, and the measures necessary to protect his medical details. Lab technicians were even exploiting Presley's ill-health by selling samples of his blood and urine.<ref name=Clayton-293>Clayton and Heard, p.293</ref>

In his book, ''Elvis: The Final Years'', Jerry Hopkins writes: "Elvis' health plummeted as his weight ballooned." At a University of [[Maryland]] concert on September 27 (1974), band members "had trouble recognizing him. ... 'He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody was scared.' Guitarist John Wilkinson ... recalled, ... 'He was all gut. He was slurring. ... It was obvious he was drugged, that there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad, the words to the songs were barely intelligible. ... We were in a state of shock.' "

Despite this, his "thundering" live version of "[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]" won him a Grammy award in 1974.<ref>Jorgensen, p.381.</ref> Presley won three competitive "Grammies" for his [[gospel music|gospel]] recordings: "How Great Thou Art"&mdash;the album, as well as the single&mdash;and for the album ''[[He Touched Me]]'' (1972). (He had fourteen nominations during his career, though it has been claimed that "Elvis has never been adequately appreciated by those who give the Grammies.")<ref>Roy 1985, p.131.</ref>

In April 1974, rumors began that he would actually be playing overseas after years of offers.<ref name=Stanley-123>Stanley and Coffey, p.123</ref> A $1,000,000 bid came in from a source in Australia for him to tour there, but Colonel Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant to accept such large sums. This prompted those closest to Presley to speculate about Parker's past and circumstances, and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport to travel abroad. He set aside any notions Presley had of overseas work by citing poor security in other countries, and the lack of suitable venues for a star of his status. Presley apparently accepted such excuses, at the time.<ref name=Stanley-123 />

Presley continued to play to sell-out crowds in the U.S.; a 1975 tour ended with a concert in [[Pontiac, Michigan]], attended by over 62,000 fans. However the singer now had "no motivation to lose his extra poundage... he became self-conscious... his self-confidence before the audience declined... Headlines such as 'Elvis Battles Middle Age' and 'Time Makes Listless Machine of Elvis' were not uncommon."<ref>Roy, p.70</ref> According to Marjorie Garber, when Presley made his later appearances in Las Vegas, he appeared "heavier, in pancake make-up... with an elaborate jewelled belt and cape, crooning pop songs to a microphone ... [He] had become [[Liberace]]. Even his fans were now middle-aged matrons and blue-haired grandmothers, ... [[Mother's Day]] became a special holiday for Elvis' fans."<ref>Garber, ''Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing & Cultural Anxiety'' (1992), p.380</ref>

On July 13, 1976, Presley's father fired "Memphis Mafia" bodyguards Red West, Sonny West and David Hebler. All three were taken by surprise, especially the Wests, who had been with Presley since the beginning of his career.<ref name=Stanley-139>Stanley and Coffey, p.139</ref> Presley was away in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] when it happened, and some suggest the singer was too cowardly to face them himself.<ref name=Hopkins-354>Hopkins 2007, p.354</ref> Vernon Presley cited the need to "cut back on expenses" when dismissing the three, but David Stanley has claimed they were really fired because of becoming more outspoken about Presley's drug dependency.<ref name=Stanley-140>Stanley and Coffey, p.140</ref> A "trusted associate" of Presley, John O'Grady, also stated, in agreement with Parker and Vernon Presley, that the bodyguards "were too rough with the fans... resulting in a lot of unnecessary lawsuits" and lawyers' fees.<ref name=Hopkins-354 /> The Wests and Hebler would later write a devastating indictment of Presley, notably his drug-taking, in the book: ''[[Steve Dunleavy|Elvis: What Happened?]]'', published August 1, 1977.<ref name=Stanley-148>Stanley and Coffey, p.148</ref>

Almost throughout the 1970s, Presley's recording label had been increasingly concerned about making money from Presley material: RCA Victor often had to rely on live recordings because of problems getting him to attend studio sessions. A mobile studio was occasionally sent to Graceland in the hope of capturing an inspired vocal performance. Once in a studio, he could lack interest or be easily distracted; often this was linked to his health and drug problems.<ref name="Guralnick-passim"/>

== Final year and death ==
In 2006, a journalist recalled: "Elvis Presley had [in 1977] become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self... he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts."<ref>Scherman, T. (August 16, 2006). "Elvis Dies". ''American Heritage''.</ref> In [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], the singer was on stage for less than an hour and "was impossible to understand."<ref name=Guralnick-628>Guralnick 1999, p.628</ref> In [[Baton Rouge]], Presley failed to appear: he was unable to get out of his hotel bed, and the rest of the tour was cancelled.<ref name=Guralnick-628/>
In [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] on May 20, "there was no longer any pretence of keeping up appearances. The idea was simply to get Elvis out on stage and keep him upright..."<ref name = "tefeqq"/> Despite his obvious problems, shows in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] and [[Rapid City, South Dakota]] were recorded for an album and a CBS-TV special: ''[[Elvis In Concert]]''.<ref name=autogenerated8>Guralnick 1999, pp.637-8</ref>

In Rapid City, "he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk... He was undoubtedly painfully aware of how he looked, and he knew that in his condition, he could not perform any significant movement."<ref>Roy, ''Elvis: Prophet of Power'', p.71.</ref> His performance in Omaha "exceeded everyone's worst fears... [giving] the impression of a man crying out for help..."<ref name=autogenerated8 /> According to Guralnick, fans "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Elvis, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his [spiritualism] books."<ref name = "tefeqq">Guralnick 1999, p.634</ref> A cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how Presley would sit in his room and chat, recounting things like his favorite [[Monty Python]] sketches and his own past japes, but "mostly there was a grim obsessiveness... a paranoia about people, germs... future events", that reminded Smith of [[Howard Hughes]].<ref>Guralnick 1999, p.212 and 642</ref>

[[File:Elvis' tomb.jpg|thumb|230px|Elvis Presley's final resting place at [[Graceland]]]]

The book ''[[Steve Dunleavy|Elvis: What Happened?]]'' was the first exposé to detail Presley's years of drug misuse, and was apparently the authors' revenge for them being sacked, and, too, a plea to get Presley to recognize the extent of his drug problems.<ref>[http://www.elvispresleynews.com/ElvisAutopsy.html Review of Medical Report]. ''ElvisPresleyNews.com''. Retrieved 2007-10-12.</ref> The singer "was devastated by the book. Here were his close friends who had written serious stuff that would affect his life.

Presley's final performance was in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] at the [[Market Square Arena]], on June 26, 1977. According to many of his entourage who accompanied him on tour, it was the "best show he had given in a long time" with "some strong singing".<ref name=Clutton/>

Another tour was scheduled to begin August 17, 1977, but at Graceland the day before, Presley was found on his bathroom floor by fiancée, [[Ginger Alden]]. According to the medical investigator, Presley had "stumbled or crawled several feet before he died"; he had apparently been using the toilet at the time.<ref name=Guralnick-1999-651>Guralnick 1999, p.651</ref> Death was officially pronounced at 3:30 pm at the Baptist Memorial Hospital.

Before his funeral, hundreds of thousands of fans, the press and celebrities lined the streets and many hoped to see the open casket in Graceland. One of Presley's cousins, Bobby Mann,<ref name=Clutton/> accepted $18,000 to secretly photograph the corpse; the picture duly appeared on the cover of the [[National Enquirer]], making it the largest and fastest selling issue of all time.<ref name=Hopkins-386>Hopkins 2007, p.386</ref> Two days after the singer's death, a car plowed into a group of 2000 fans outside Presley's home, killing two women and critically injuring a third.<ref>Matthew-Walker 1979, p.26</ref> Among the mourners at the funeral were Ann-Margret (who had remained close to Presley) and his ex-wife.<ref name=Clayton-394>Clayton and Heard, p.394.</ref> [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] issued a statement (See '[[#Legacy|Legacy]]').<ref>Woolley, John T.; Gerhard Peters.

On Thursday, August 18, following a funeral service at Graceland,<ref name=Clutton/> Elvis Presley was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis, next to his mother.

Presley had developed many health problems during his life, some of them chronic.<ref>Baden and Hennessee, p.35 "Elvis had an enlarged heart for a long time. That, together with his drug habit, caused his death. But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call."</ref> Opinions differ regarding the onset of his drug abuse. He did take [[amphetamines]] regularly in the army; it has been claimed that pills of some form were first given to him by Memphis DJ [[Dewey Phillips]],<ref>Goldman, Albert, ''Elvis: The Last 24 Hours,'' p. 9</ref> but Presley's friend Lamar Fike has said: "Elvis got his first uppers from what he stole from his mother. Gladys was given [[Dexedrine]] to help her with her 'change of life' problems."<ref name="Cause Of Death"/> Priscilla Presley saw "problems in Elvis' life, all magnified by taking prescribed drugs." Presley's physician, Dr. Nichopoulos, has said: "[Elvis] felt that by getting [pills] from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday [[junkie]] getting something off the street. He... thought that as far as medications and drugs went, there was something for everything."<ref name=DrFeelgood/>

According to Guralnick: "[D]rug use was heavily implicated... no one ruled out the possibility of [[anaphylactic shock]] brought on by the [[codeine]] pills... to which he was known to have had a mild allergy." In two lab reports filed two months later, each indicated "a strong belief that the primary cause of death was [[polypharmacy]]," with one report "indicating the detection of fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity."<ref>Guralnick, p.652</ref>

The medical profession has been seriously questioned. [[Coroner|Medical Examiner]] Dr. Jerry Francisco had publicly offered a cause of death while the autopsy was still being performed, but before [[toxicology]] results were known. Dr. Francisco dubiously stated that [[cardiac arrhythmia]] was the cause of death, a condition that can only be determined in a living person&mdash;not [[Autopsy|post mortem]].<ref name=CourtTV>"[http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/forensics/cyril_wecht/4.html Coverup for a King]".

On January 20, 1980, the board found [against] him... but decided that he was not unethical [because he claimed he'd been trying to wean the singer off the drugs]." His license was suspended. In July 1995, it was permanently revoked after it was found he had improperly dispensed drugs to several patients including [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].<ref name=DrFeelgood/>

In 1994, the autopsy into Presley's death was re-opened. Coroner Dr. Joseph Davis declared: "There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs [i.e. [[drug overdose]]].

Presley has featured prominently in a variety of polls and surveys designed to measure popularity and influence.{{fn|g}} However, sociologist Philip Ennis writes: "Perhaps it is an error of enthusiasm to freight Elvis Presley with too heavy a historical load" because, according to a opinion poll of high school students in 1957, [[Pat Boone]] was nearly the "two-to-one favorite over Elvis Presley among boys and preferred almost three-to-one by girls..."<ref>See Ennis, Philip H., ''The Seventh Stream: The Emergence of Rocknroll in American Popular Music'' (Wesleyan University Press, 1992), pp.251-252.</ref> Despite this, and unlike Pat Boone, Presley's early music and live performances are credited with helping to lay a commercial foundation which allowed established black music acts of the 1950s to receive due recognition.

By 1958, singers obviously adopting Presley's style, like [[Marty Wilde]] and [[Cliff Richard]] (the so-called "British Elvis"), were rising to prominence in the UK. Elsewhere, France's [[Johnny Hallyday]] and the Italians [[Adriano Celentano]] and Bobby Solo were also heavily influenced by Presley.<ref>"[http://www.rfimusique.com/siteen/biographie/biographie_6309.asp Johnny Hallyday biography]".

Presley's recorded voice is seen by many as his enduring legacy. Music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] writes: "Elvis Presley has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor. An extraordinary compass... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion. The voice covers two octaves and a third ... Moreover, he has not been confined to one type of vocal production. In ballads and country songs he belts out full-voiced high G's and A's that an opera baritone might envy. He is a naturally assimilative stylist with a multiplicity of voices&mdash;in fact, Elvis' is an extraordinary voice, or many voices."<ref name=Wikiquote/> It has also been noted that "Presley’s comprehensive musical knowledge and talent also surprised and impressed [[songwriters]] [[Jerry Leiber]] and [[Mike Stoller]]... [They] considered Presley to be an '[[idiot savant]]' because he knew so many songs. His knowledge of the blues especially impressed them. Leiber remembers that Presley "could imitate anything he heard. He had a perfect ear,"... Presley could sing and/or play a song on the piano after hearing it only once or twice. His natural ear for music, ability to play by ear, and to improvise were well known to his friends and musical associates."<ref name=Cook-20 />

Gospel tenor Shawn Nielsen, who sang backing vocals for Presley on tour, said: "He could sing anything. I've never seen such versatility... He had such great soul. He had the ability to make everyone in the audience think that he was singing directly to them. He just had a way with communication that was totally unique."<ref name=Wikiquote /><ref name="Khurana"/>

Presley's informal jamming in front of a small audience in the [['68 Comeback Special]] is regarded as a forerunner of the so-called 'Unplugged' concept, later popularized by [[MTV]].<ref>Johnson, Brett (2004-06-28).

The singer has been inducted into four music 'Halls of Fame': the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1986), the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] (1997), the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] (1998), and the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] (2001). In 1984, he received the [[W. C. Handy]] Award from the [[Blues Foundation]] and the [[Academy of Country Music]]’s first Golden Hat Award. In 1987, he received the [[American Music Awards]]’ first posthumous presentation of the Award of Merit.<ref>Cook, p.33</ref>

Presley has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7080 [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. He was also honored by the Mississippi Blues Commission with a [[Mississippi Blues Trail]] historic marker placed in [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]], his birth place, in recognition of his contribution to the development of the blues in Mississippi.<ref>

In 1994, the 40th anniversary of Presley's "That's All Right" was recognized with its re-release, which made the charts worldwide, making top three in the UK.

During the [[Football World Cup 2002|2002 World Cup]] a [[Junkie XL]] remix of his "[[A Little Less Conversation]]" (credited as "Elvis Vs JXL") topped the charts in over twenty countries and was included in a compilation of Presley's U.S. and UK number one hits, [[Elv1s: 30]].

In the UK charts (January 2005), three re-issued singles again went to number one ("[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]", "[[One Night (song)|One Night]]"/"[[I Got Stung]]" and "[[It's Now or Never (song)|It's Now or Never]]"). Throughout the year, twenty singles were re-issued&mdash;all making top five.

In the same year, ''Forbes'' magazine named Presley, for the fifth straight year, the top-earning deceased celebrity, grossing US$45 million for the Presley estate during the preceding year. In mid-2006, top place was taken by Nirvana's [[Kurt Cobain]] after the sale of his song catalogue, but Presley reclaimed the top spot in 2007.<ref>Goldman, Lea; David M. Ewalt, eds. (2007-10-29).

Paul F. Campos has written: "The Elvis cult touches on so many crucial nerves of American popular culture: the ascent of a workingclass boy from the most obscure backwater to international fame and fortune; the white man with the soul of black music in his voice; the performer whose music tied together the main strands of American folk music – country, rhythm and blues, and gospel; and, perhaps most compellingly for a weight-obsessed nation, the sexiest man in America's gradual transformation into a fat, sweating parody of his former self, straining the bounds of a jewel-encrusted bodysuit on a Las Vegas stage. The images of fat Elvis and thin Elvis live together in the popular imagination."<ref>Campos, Paul F., ''The Obesity Myth: Why America's Obsession with Weight is Hazardous to Your Health'' (2004), p.81.</ref> The singer continues to be imitated&mdash;and parodied&mdash;outside the main music industry and Presley songs remain very popular on the [[karaoke]] circuit. People from a diversity of cultures and backgrounds work as [[Elvis impersonator]]s ("the raw 1950s Elvis and the kitschy 1970s Elvis are the favorites.")<ref>Stecopoulos, p.198</ref>

In 2002, it was observed: {{quotation|For those too young to have experienced Elvis Presley in his prime, today’s celebration of the 25th anniversary of his death must seem peculiar. All the talentless impersonators and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory. But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force... Elvis’s breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.|''[[The New York Times]]''<ref>(August 16, 2002).

<div class="references-small">
* {{fnb|a}} Presley's genuine birth certificate reads "Elvis ''Aaron'' Presley" (as written by a doctor). There is also a souvenir birth certificate that reads "Elvis ''Aron'' Presley." When Presley did sign his middle name, he used Aron. It reads 'Aron' on his marriage certificate and on his army duffel bag. Aron was apparently the spelling the Presleys used to make it similar to the middle name of Elvis' stillborn twin, Jesse ''Garon''. Elvis later sought to change the name's spelling to the traditional and biblical Aaron. In the process he learned that "official state records had always listed it as Aaron. Therefore, he always was, officially, Elvis Aaron Presley." Knowing Presley's plans for his middle name, Aaron is the spelling his father chose for Elvis' tombstone, and it is the spelling his estate has designated as the official spelling whenever the middle name is used today. His death certificate says "Elvis Aron Presley." This quirk has helped inflame the "[[Elvis Presley phenomenon|Elvis is not dead]]" conspiracy theories.<ref name=Aaron />

* {{fnb|d}} In 1973, Presley was keen to produce a karate movie/documentary, enlisting the help of several top instructors and film-makers. Instructor Rick Husky says: "...Basically [our meeting] never went anywhere... Elvis got up and did some demonstrations with Ed [Parker], you know stumbled around a little bit, and it was very sad." Husky was aware that Presley was "stoned." "Colonel" Parker thought the project was folly&mdash;and a drain on their resources&mdash;from the start. (Guralnick 1994, p.531 and in passim). The film footage was finally edited, restored and released as ''The New Gladiators'' in 2002.[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809776982/info New Gladiators (2002)] ''[[Yahoo!]] Movies''.
