{{Documentation subpage}}
<!-- Categories go at the bottom of this page and interwikis go in Wikidata. -->

== Usage ==
This template can be used within {{tl|sidebar}} to wrap links which are normally not broken by whitespace, such as in the title.

<pre>
{{wraplink|link|title}}
</pre>

<code>title</code> is optional, and is used as though the link were piped.
