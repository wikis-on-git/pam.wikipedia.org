The SportsChannel America deal was in a sense, a power play created by [[Charles Dolan]] and [[Bill Wirtz]]. Dolan was still several years away from getting control of [[Madison Square Garden]], and Wirtz owned 25% of [[SportsChannel Chicago]]. [[NHL commissioner|NHL president]] [[John Ziegler Jr.|John Ziegler]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://puckjunk.com/2018/10/29/john-ziegler-did-more-harm-than-good-for-hockey/|title=John Ziegler Did More Harm Than Good for Hockey|last=Barry|first=Sal|date=October 29, 2018|website=Puck Junk}}</ref> convinced the [[National Hockey League#Organizational structure|board of governors]] that SportsChannel America was a better alternative than a proposed NHL Channel backed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]] that had interests in the [[MSG Network]] and [[NESN]].

===SportsChannel's availability===
Unfortunately, [[SportsChannel America]] was only available in a few<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hockeybuzz.com/blog/Guest-Writer/The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly-of-John-Zieglers-NHL-reign/163/95608|title=The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of John Ziegler's NHL reign|last=Moncour|first=Gilles|date=October 29, 2018|website=HockeyBuzz.com}}</ref> major markets (notably absent though were [[Detroit]], [[Pittsburgh]] and [[St. Louis]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Strachan|first=Al|date=March 15, 2005|title=NHL needs a TV partner|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Columnists/Strachan/2005/03/15/961494.html|work=Toronto Sun}}</ref>)<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=A+nation+wept+as+its+hero%2C+NHL+star+Wayne+Gretzky%2C+was+-+08.22.88+-+SI+Vault&expire=&urlID=431512307&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1067639%2F4%2Findex.htm&partnerID=289881|title=Woe, Canada|date=August 22, 1988|first=E.M.|last=Swift|journal=Sports Illustrated}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=NHL broadcast boss pleased with cable move|date=May 2, 1989|first=Rudy|last=Martzke|newspaper=USA Today|page=3C}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Staudohar|first=Paul D.|date= 31 May 2018|title=Playing for Dollars: Labor Relations and the Sports Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XLdcDwAAQBAJ&q=1990+nhl+all+star+game+on+nbc&pg=PA138|publisher= Cornell University Press|page=138|isbn= 9781501717857}}</ref> and reached only a 1/3 of the households that [[ESPN]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Ryan|first=Bob|date=October 3, 1991|title=Underexposed NHL needs to write Dear John letter to Ziegler|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1991-10-03-1991276186-story.html|work=Baltimore Sun}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://puckjunk.com/2018/10/29/john-ziegler-did-more-harm-than-good-for-hockey/|title=John Ziegler Did More Harm Than Good for Hockey|last=Barry|first=Sal|date=October 29, 2018|website=Punk Junk}}</ref> did at the time.<ref>{{cite book |title=Playing for dollars: labor relations and the sports business |last=Staudohar |first= Paul D. |year=1996 |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/playingfordollar00stau/page/n150 137] |url=https://archive.org/details/playingfordollar00stau |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1988/06/27/117913/a-better-open-too-much-brent-abc-improved-at-brookline-but-brent-musburgers-ego-showed-in-the-nba-finals|title=A Better Open; Too Much Brent|date=June 27, 1988|journal=Sports Illustrated|first=William|last=Taaffe}}</ref> SportsChannel America was seen in fewer than 10 million households.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Scorecard+-+01.16.89+-+SI+Vault&expire=&urlID=431512642&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1126461%2F2%2Findex.htm&partnerID=289881|date=January 16, 1989|journal=Sports Illustrated|title=Scorecard}}</ref> In comparison, by the [[1991–92 NHL season|1991–92 season]], ESPN was available in 60.5 million<ref>{{cite book |last=Gatehouse|first=Jonathon|date= October 2012|title=The Instigator: How Gary Bettman Remade the NHL and Changed the Game Forever|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ryb0O7riZnQC&q=John+Ziegler+SportsChannel+America+nhl&pg=PA158|publisher= Triumph Books|page=158|isbn= 9781623686567}}</ref> homes whereas SportsChannel America was available in only 25 million.

SportsChannel America took advantage of using their [[regional sports network]]s' feed of a game, graphics and all, instead of producing a show from the ground up, most of the time. Distribution of SportsChannel America across the country was limited to cities that had a SportsChannel regional sports network or affiliate. Very few cable systems in non-NHL territories picked it up as a stand-alone service. Regional affiliates of the [[Prime Network]] would sometimes pick up SportsChannel broadcasts, but this was often only during the playoffs, and often to justify the cost, some cable providers carrying it during the playoffs only carried it as a [[pay-per-view]] option. SportsChannel America also did not broadcast 24 hours a day at first, usually on by 6 p.m., off by 12 Midnight, then a [[Sports Plus Network|sportsticker]] for the next 18 hours.

====Philadelphia====
Since [[SportsChannel Philadelphia]] did not air until January [[1990 in television|1990]], [[PRISM (TV channel)|PRISM]] (owned by Rainbow Media, the owners of SportsChannel, at the time) picked up the [[1989 Stanley Cup Finals]]. Other than that, there was no NHL television coverage in Philadelphia except for the [[Philadelphia Flyers|Flyers]] for the first half of the original deal.

===Lawsuit===
As previously mentioned, the NHL would return to ESPN following the [[1991–92 NHL season|1991–92 season]]. Shortly after the ESPN deal was signed, SportsChannel America would contend that its contract with the NHL gave them the right to match third-party offers for television rights for the [[1992–93 NHL season|1992–93 season]]. SportsChannel America accused the NHL of violating a nonbinding clause. SportsChannel America argued that it had been deprived of its contractual [[right of first refusal]] for the 1992–93 season. [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court]] justice Shirley Fingerwood would deny SportsChannel America's request for an [[injunction]] against the NHL. Upholding that opinion, the [[Court of Appeals|appellate court]] found the agreement on which SportsChannel based its argument to be "too imprecise and ambiguous" and ruled that SportsChannel failed to show irreparable harm.

In the aftermath of losing the NHL, SportsChannel America was left with little more than outdoors shows and [[Canadian Football League]] games. For SportsChannel, the deal was a disaster overall. While the cable channel three years later, was available in 20 million homes (as previously mentioned), the broadcaster lost as much as $10 million on the agreement, and soon faded into obscurity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.njdevs.com/forums/lofiversion/index.php/t20611.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519181103/http://www.njdevs.com/forums/lofiversion/index.php/t20611.html |archive-date=2009-05-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some local SportsChannel stations – which carried NHL games in their local markets – were not affected.

==Coverage overview==

===Regular season coverage===
SportsChannel America televised about 80–100 games a season (whereas ESPN aired about 33 in the {{NHL Year|1987}} season). Whereas the previous deal with ESPN called for only one nationally televised game a week, SportsChannel America televised hockey two nights a week in NHL cities and three nights a week elsewhere.

It was very rare to have a regular-season game on SportsChannel America that wasn't a regional SportsChannel production from the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], [[Hartford Whalers]], [[New Jersey Devils]], [[New York Islanders]] or [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. The [[San Jose Sharks]] were added in {{NHL Year|1991}}. As previously suggested, SportsChannel America for the most part, used the local telecasts. The dedicated SportsChannel America station was little more than an overflow channel in the New York area for SportsChannel New York.

===Special programming===
In [[1989 in television|1989]], SportsChannel America provided the first ever American coverage of the [[1989 NHL Entry Draft|NHL Draft]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=A look at the NHL's 27th draft|date=June 16, 1989|first=Kevin|last=Allen|newspaper=USA Today|page=8C}}</ref> In September 1989, SportsChannel America covered the [[1989–90 Washington Capitals season|Washington Capitals]]' training camp in Sweden and [[Season (sports)|pre-season]] tour<ref>{{Cite news|title=Soviets In, With Army and Dynamo|newspaper=Washington Post|date=December 26, 1988|first=Robert|last=Fachet}}</ref> of the Soviet Union. The Capitals were joined by the Stanley Cup champion [[Calgary Flames]], who held training camp in [[Prague, Czechoslovakia]] and then ventured to the Soviet Union. Each team played four games against [[Soviet National League]] clubs. Games were played in Moscow, [[Leningrad]], [[Kiev]] and [[Riga]]. The NHL clubs finished with a combined 6–2 record against the top Soviet teams, including the [[HC CSKA Moscow|Red Army]] club and [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]. Five of the eight contests were televised by SportsChannel America.

====All-Star Game coverage====
SportsChannel America was the exclusive American broadcaster of the [[40th National Hockey League All-Star Game|1989 All-Star Game]]. The [[41st National Hockey League All-Star Game|following year]], they covered the first ever [[NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition|NHL Skills Competition]] and Heroes of Hockey game. SportsChannel America would continue their coverage of these particular events through [[43rd National Hockey League All-Star Game|1992]]. In [[1991 in American television|1991]], SportsChannel America replayed the third period of the [[42nd National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] on the same day that it was played. That was because [[NHL on NBC|NBC]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=1991 NHL All-Star Game, Chicago Stadium (intros, anthems)|id=tU-CXpNg5zg&t}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|title=1991 NHL All-Star Game, Chicago Stadium (first period)|id=2LuQnlASRR0}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|title=1991 NHL All-Star Game, Chicago Stadium (first intermission, second period)|id=qn19PhmEJYo}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|title=1991 NHL All-Star Game, Chicago Stadium (second intermission, third period)|id=a8hfii3Xqfc&t}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/14/sports/tv-sports-stars-and-penguins-cable-compatible.html?pagewanted=print|title=TV SPORTS; Stars and Penguins: Cable Compatible|date=May 14, 1991|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref><ref name=1991AllStarGame>{{cite news|title=All-Star Game pinpoints NHL's limited exposure|date=January 18, 1991|first=Jack|last=Craig|newspaper=Boston Globe}}</ref> broke away from the live telecast during the third period in favor of [[Gulf War]] coverage.

==Production==
A fair number of times in their first season, they would use their own production services for games. But very rarely would this sort of practice occur in the last three seasons. Since programming was so sparse otherwise on SportsChannel America, usually the games were replayed immediately following the live telecast.

For playoff coverage,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Schmidt tries to ease into broadcasting job|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 5, 1990|first=Michael|last=Hiestand|page=3C}}</ref> if any of the aforementioned teams made the playoffs, SportsChannel America focus on those teams, using their facilities. For example, [[SportsChannel Chicago]] produced the SportsChannel America coverage for the [[1989–90 Chicago Blackhawks season|Blackhawks]]' 1990 playoff run. Because of Hawks owner [[Bill Wirtz]]'s disdain for free and basic cable home telecasts of his games, the road games were shown in Chicago, with the home games only given short live look-ins as "bonus coverage". The same occurrence happened in 1992, but this time, [[1991–92 Chicago Blackhawks season|Blackhawks]]' home games were broadcast on a pay-per-view basis via "[[Hawkvision]]".<ref>{{cite news |last=Wilbon|first=Michael|date=June 1, 1992|title=FOR NHL TO GROW, ZIEGLER'S GOT TO GO|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1992/06/01/for-nhl-to-grow-zieglers-got-to-go/4cca3fce-dabf-4e86-83be-0bc08773d992/|work=Washington Post}}</ref> Sometimes, they would use the [[Hockey Night in Canada|CBC]] feed for other series (the [[Bruins–Canadiens rivalry|Boston Bruins–Montréal Canadiens]] series, for example). For the [[Stanley Cup Finals]], SportsChannel America used their own facilities. They would also use their own facilities for any Conference Final series that did not involve one of SportsChannel's regional teams. In 1989, both Conference Finals series involved two of SportsChannel's regional teams ([[1988–89 Philadelphia Flyers season|Philadelphia]] and [[1988–89 Chicago Blackhawks season|Chicago]]). SportsChannel asked [[Jiggs McDonald]] and [[Herb Brooks]] to call the Clarence Campbell Conference Final between [[1988–89 Calgary Flames season|Calgary]] and [[1988–89 Chicago Blackhawks season|Chicago]] on SportsChannel America. SportsChannel America's [[master control]] was at a [[Cablevision]] studio in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] with its NHL studios located at [[Adelphi University]] on [[Long Island]].

John Shannon was the senior producer of ''The NHL on SportsChannel America''.

===Announcers===
[[Bob Papa]]<ref>{{Cite news|title=Lighter load at ABC doesn't bother McKay|date=April 12, 1990|first=Steve|last=Woodward|newspaper=USA Today|page=3C}}</ref> and [[Leandra Reilly]] were the studio hosts during the regular season coverage. [[Denis Potvin]] was the studio analyst during the regular season coverage. For the [[Stanley Cup Finals]], [[Jiggs McDonald]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=Cup Finals close 1992 SC America|id=fK3AdHkw9dw}}</ref> called the [[play-by-play]], and [[Bill Clement]] was the [[color commentator]]. Also during the Stanley Cup Finals, [[Mike Emrick]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=Flames win Stanley Cup SC America 1989|id=lg9n8iO5SEA}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|title=1990 Stanley Cup Finals - Game 5 - Opening (Sportschannel)|id=_tdIvJKy6YQ}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|title=5/25/91 – Penguins Win First Stanley Cup (3 – SportsChannel) |id=xeNDuG1qLSU}}</ref> served as the host while [[John Davidson (ice hockey)|John Davidson]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Bradley|first=Jeff|date=May 13, 1991|title=A Strong Voice for Hockey|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1991/05/13/124200/a-strong-voice-for-hockey-john-davidson-has-become-his-sports-top-broadcaster-in-part-by-outworking-everybody-else-title%253DA|work=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> served as the rinkside<ref>{{YouTube|title=Mark Messier Interview - 1990 Stanley Cup|id=KsQ93XJHdYs}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|title=5/25/91 – Penguins Win First Stanley Cup (1 – SportsChannel)|id=KsQ93XJHdYs}}</ref> and intermission analyst<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1991/05/13/124200/a-strong-voice-for-hockey-john-davidson-has-become-his-sports-top-broadcaster-in-part-by-outworking-everybody-else|title=A Strong Voice For Hockey|date=May 13, 1991|first=Jeff|last=Bradley|journal=Sports Illustrated}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=The+Penguins+staked+a+claim+to+greatness+by+winning+-+06.08.92+-+SI+Vault&expire=&urlID=411698607&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1003855%2F2%2Findex.htm&partnerID=289881|title=Swept Away|date=June 8, 1992|first=Jon|last=Scher|journal=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> ([[Herb Brooks]] filled that role in 1989).
