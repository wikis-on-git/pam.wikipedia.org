'''Iligan''' is a 1st class [[Philippine city|city]] in the [[Philippine province|province]] of [[Lanao del Norte province|Lanao del Norte]], [[Philippines]], and the province's former capital. It is approximately 800 kilometers southeast of [[Manila]]. According to the [[2000]] census, it has a population of 399,061 people in 57,179 households.

Iligan City is bounded on the north by the municipality of [[Lugait, Misamis Oriental]], to the south by the municipalities of [[Baloi, Lanao del Norte|Baloi]] and [[Linamon, Lanao del Norte|Linamon]] of [[Lanao del Norte]], to the east by the territories of [[Lanao del Sur]] and [[Bukidnon]], and to the west by [[Iligan Bay]].

Known as the '''''City of Majestic Waterfalls''''', there are more than 20 waterfalls in and around Iligan. Among them is the magnificent '''[[Maria Cristina Falls]]''', home of [[Mindanao]]'s primary [[hydroelectric]] power station, and '''[[Limonsodan Falls]]''', believed to be Asia's highest waterfall.

Iligan is also the '''''Industrial Center of the South'''''. It produces hydroelectric power for the Mindanao region through the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR), the site of the Mindanao Regional Center (MRC) housing Agus IV, VI and VII hydroelectric plants. It also houses industries like steel, tinplate, pulp and paper and flourmills. The National Steel Corporation, one of the largest steel manufacturers in the Southeast Asian region, now Global Steelworks International Incorporated was re-opened in 2003 after heavy setbacks resulting to its closure in 1999. Iligan along with its neighboring city, [[Cagayan de Oro]] City, are the two major components for the Cagayan-Iligan Corridor, the fastest developing area in northern [[Mindanao]].

Iligan City is not only rich in natural resources and industries but it is also the home of a mix of cultures, Maranaos of Lanao del Sur, Higaonons of Bukidnon, and many settlers and migrants from other parts of the country. The climate is consistent year around since Iligan is outside the [[Typhoon|typhoon belt]] with an average temperature of just 22 degrees Celsius, and average rainfall of 109 mm per month.

To the west [[Iligan Bay]] provides ferry and container ship transportation. East of the city, flat cultivated coastal land gives way to steep volcanic hills and mountains providing the waterfalls and cold springs for which the area is well known.

==People and culture==
Iligan is predominantly Christian (93.61%). Iliganons are a mixture of the Muslim and Cebuano population with a minority of Tagalog and some other cultural minorities and immigrants from other places.

Iligan City is known for its diverse culture and is also known as the city of waterfalls. 
 
The Mayor of Iligan City is Mayor Lawrence Lluch Cruz.

[[Cebuano]] is the major dialect in the city (about 93%). The rest speak [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Maranao]], [[Hiligaynon]], [[Ilokano language|Ilocano]], [[Chavacano]], and [[Waray-Waray]]. The majority of the population is fluent in  [[English language|English]].

==History==
[[Image:Higaunon.gif|right]]
Iligan has its beginnings in the village of Bayug, 2.5 kilometers north of the present Poblacion. It was the earliest pre-Spanish settlement of native sea dwellers, known as [[Maragat]]s. The monotony of indigenous life in the territory was broken when in the later part of the 16th century, the inhabitants of Iligan were subdued by the Visayan migrants from the island kingdom of [[Panglao]].

In the accounts of Jesuit historian Fr. [[Francisco Combes]], the Mollucan King of [[Ternate]] invaded Panglao. This caused Panglaons to flee in large numbers to [[Dapitan City|Dapitan]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]]. In Dapitan, the surviving Prince of Panglao, [[Pagbuaya]], received Legazpi's expedition in [[1565]]. Later, Pagbuaya's son Manook was baptized [[Pedro Manuel Manook]]. The Christianized Manook subdued the Higaunon village in Bayug and established it as one of the earliest Christian settlements in the country. The settlement survived other raids from other enemies, and, because of their faith in God and in their patron saint, Saint [[Michael the Archangel]], the early Iliganons moved their settlement from Bayug to Iligan.

The name Iligan is from the [[Higaunon]] word "iligan" or "ilijan," meaning "fortress of defense" against frequent attacks by pirates and other hostile Mindanao tribes.

In [[1850]], because of floods, Don [[Remigio Cabili]], then Iligan's governadorcillo, built another fort and moved the poblacion of the old Iligan located at the mouth of Tubod River west of the old market to its present site.

[[Image:Calesa1.gif|left]]
A stone fort called Fort St. [[Francis Xavier]] was built in 1642 where Iliganons sought refuge during raids by bandits. But again, the fort sank due to floods. Another fort was built and this was named [[Fort Victoria]] or Cota de Iligan.

The Spaniards abandoned Iligan in [[1899]], paving the way for the landing of the American forces in [[1900]]. In 1914, under the restructuring of Moroland after the end of the Moro Province (1903-1913), Iligan became a municipality composed of eight barrios side-by-side the municipal district of Mandulog. After enjoying peace and prosperity for about 40 years, Iligan was invaded by Japanese forces in [[1942]]. The Japanese held sway in the city until [[1944]] when they left Iligan suddenly. On [[November 15]], [[1944]], the city held a Commonwealth Day parade to celebrate the end of Japanese atrocities and occupation.

Using the same territorial definition as a municipality, Iligan became a chartered city of Lanao del Norte on [[June 16]], [[1950]]. It was declared a first class city in [[1969]] and was reclassified as First Class City "A" on [[July 1]], [[1977]] by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 465. In [[1983]], Iligan was again reclassified as a highly urbanized city.
