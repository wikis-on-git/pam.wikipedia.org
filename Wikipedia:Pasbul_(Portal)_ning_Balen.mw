==Betawiki: better support for your language in MediaWiki==
Dear community. I am writing to you to promote a special wiki called [[betawiki:|Betawiki]]. This wiki facilitates the localisation (l10n) of the MediaWiki interface. You may have changed many messages here to use your language in the interface, but if you would log in to for example the Japanese language Wiktionary, you would not be able to use the interface as well translated as here. In fact, of 1,736 messages in the core of MediaWiki, 12.32% of the messages have been translated. Betawiki also supports the translation of messages for 126 extensions, with 2,174 messages. Many of them are used in WMF projects and they are vital for understanding the wiki. Currently 6.53% of the WMF extension messages have been translated. Translators for over 90 languages contribute their work to MediaWiki this way every month.

If you wish to contribute to better support of your language in MediaWiki, as well as for many MediaWiki extensions, please visit [[betawiki:Translating:Intro|Betawiki]], [http://translatewiki.net/w/?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup&uselang=en create an account] and [[betawiki:Betawiki:Rights|request translator privileges]]. You can see the current status of localisation of your language on [[mw:Localisation_statistics|MediaWiki.org]] and do not forget to get in touch with others that may already be [[betawiki:Translating:Languages|working on your language on Betawiki]].

If you have any further questions, [[betawiki:User_talk:GerardM|please let me know on my talk page on Betawiki]]. We will try and assist you as much as possible, for example by [[betawiki:Import requests|importing]] all messages from a local wiki for you to start with, if you so desire.

You can also find us on the Freenode [[w:en:Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] network in the channel #mediawiki-i18n where we will be happy to help you get started.

Thank you very much for your attention and I do hope to see some of you on [[betawiki:|Betawiki]] soon! Thanks, [[betawiki:User:GerardM|GerardM@Betawiki]]

==The village pump==
Could someome be so kind and move my contribution to your "village pump" and also, could someone please add a link to your village pump on [[meta:International names for Village Pump|meta]] [[User:GerardM|GerardM]] 09:33, 30 January 2008 (UTC)
==Bot policy==
Hello. To facilitate [[m:steward|steward]] granting of bot access, I suggest implementing the [[m:Bot policy|standard bot policy]] on this wiki. In particular, this policy allows stewards to automatically flag known interlanguage linking bots (if this page says that is acceptable), which form the vast majority of such requests. The policy also enables [[m:Bot policy#Global_bots|global bots]] on this wiki (if this page says that is acceptable), which are trusted bots that will be given bot access on every wiki that allows global bots.

This policy makes bot access requesting much easier for local users, operators, and stewards. To implement it we only need to create a redirect to this page from [[Project:Bot policy]], and add a line at the top noting that it is used here. Please read the text at [[m:Bot policy]] before commenting. If you object, please say so; I hope to implement in one week if there is no objection, since it is particularly written to streamline bot requests on wikis with little or no community interested in bot access requests. [[User:Carsrac|Carsrac]] 08:33, 25 Abril 2009 (UTC)
: Please make the comments on the [[Project:Bot policy]] page. I will move any botrequest from this page to the correct page. [[User:Carsrac|Carsrac]] 08:45, 25 Abril 2009 (UTC)

==The LocalisationUpdate extension has gone live==

The LocalisationUpdate extension is now enabled for all Wikimedia projects. From now on new localisations that become available in SVN will become available to your project within 24 hours. Your localisations get into SVN from [http://translatewiki.net translatewiki.net] typically within a day and at worst in two days. This is a huge improvement from the old practice where the localisations became available with new software. This could take weeks, even months.

The localisations done by our community at translatewiki.net are committed to SVN typically every day. When the system messages in English are the same as the local messages, they will now be inserted in a file and are available for use in all our projects in a timely manner

===What this means for you===
Local messages have an impact on the performance of our system. It is best when messages are as much as possible part of the system messages. In order to remove unnecessary duplication, all the messages that have a local localisation and are '''exactly''' the same as the system message will be removed.  What we ask you to do is to compare and proof read the messages in translatewiki.net and the local messages. You can then either remove local messages when the translatewiki.net message is to be preferred or, you can update the message at translatewiki.net. 

Messages that are specific to your project will have to stay as they are. You do want to check if the format and the variables of the message are still the same.

===Why localise at translatewiki.net===
When you localise at translatewiki.net, your messages will be used in all Wikimedia projects and eventually in all MediaWiki based projects. This is how we provide the standard support for your language. When messages change, at translatewiki.net you will be prompted to revisit your translations. Localising is more efficient because we have innovated the process to make you more efficient; there is text explaining about messages and we have applied AJAX technology to reduce the number of clicks you have to make.

==Translatewiki.net update==
*Currently 66.94% of the MediaWiki messages and 1.85% of the messages of the extensions used by the Wikimedia Foundation projects have been localised. Please help us help your language by localising and proof reading at [[betawiki:Special:LanguageStats/{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}|translatewiki.net]].

==How can we improve the usability for your language==
We expect that with the implementation of LocalisationUpdate the usability of MediaWiki for your language will improve. We are now ready to look at other aspects of usability for your language as well.  There are two questions we would like you to answer:
Are there issues with the new functionality of the Usability Initiative
Does MediaWiki support your language properly

The best way to answer the first question is to visit the translatewiki.net. Change the language to your language, select the “vector” skin and add the advanced tool bar in in the preferences and check out the new functionality. And make some changes in your user page. When there is a need to improve on the localisation, please make the [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=ext-ui-0-all necessary changes]s . It should update your localisation straight away. 
We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Usability_issues.

When there are problems with the support of MediaWiki for your language, we really want to know about this. It is best to report each issue separately. In this way there will be no large mass of issues to resolve but we can address each issue on its own. Consider issues with the display of characters, the presentation of your script, the position of the side bar, the combination of text with other languages, scripts. It is best to try this in an environment like the prototype wiki as it provides you with a clean, basic and up to date environment. The prototype wiki is available for five languages but you can select any of them, change the preferences to your language and test out MediaWiki for your language.

We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Language_issues. The issues you raise will all be assessed. It is important to keep each issue separate, because this will make it easier to understand the issues and find solutions.

==Fundraising 2010: Beat Jimmy Challenge==

The Fundraising Committee is issuing all interested community members a challenge: [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010 we want you to beat Jimmy]. The appeal from Jimmy Wales and the corresponding banner have been tested head-to-head with other successful banners, and the results are clear: it's our best performing message... by a lot. This year we have a lofty fundraising goal; we need all of our banners to bring in donations like the Jimmy Appeal, but no one wants to keep the Jimmy banner up for two months.  We want to run donor quotes, and other wonderful ideas, but we have to have banners that work as well as or better than the Jimmy appeal.

We've just released the highlights from a [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010#Focus_Group donor focus group], and the results of our [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FR_Donor_survey_report.pdf donor survey]. With one month to the launch of the fundraiser, the messages we test must be driven by data from our tests and surveys - we can no longer rely on instinct alone. 

We've redesigned our fundraising meta pages with the Jimmy challenge; check out the survey results and propose/discuss banners that reflect these findings.  Add the banners you think will 'beat Jimmy' [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Messages/BeatJimmy here] to be tested '''Tuesday October 12''' against Jimmy. -[[User:Dgultekin|Dgultekin]] 19:08, 6 Octubri 2010 (UTC)

==An urgent translation request==
[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|left]] Greetings :) As you may have noticed, the banners are up and we are in the final stages of testing before the official kickoff on Monday the 15th for this year's WMF fundraiser. We are in a bit of a time crunch to get the Kapampangan translations in before the Fundraiser launch on Monday. We really don't want to have English pages on the Kapampangan projects. This is a calll to to community to get involved, help translate and recruit translators to get all the fundraising materials completed. Here is the translation hub with the [[m:Fundraising_2010/appeal/en|Jimmy Appeal]], [[m:Fundraising_2010/Core_messages/en|Core Messages]], [[m:Fundraising_2010/FAQ/en|FAQ]] and [[m:Translation_requests/Benefactors/en|Benefactors]] pages that need to be completed [[m:Fundraising_2010/Translations|Translations]]. Once these are completed, we can build the new landing pages and localize the fundraiser! Thanks so much, let me know if there are any questions![[User:Klyman|Klyman]] 19:12, 13 Nobiembri 2010 (UTC)

== Call for image filter referendum ==

The Wikimedia Foundation, at the direction of the Board of Trustees, will be holding a vote to determine whether members of the community support the creation and usage of an opt-in personal image filter, which would allow readers to voluntarily screen particular types of images strictly for their own account.

Further details and educational materials will be available shortly.  The referendum is scheduled for 12-27 August, 2011, and will be conducted on servers hosted by a neutral third party.  Referendum details, officials, voting requirements, and supporting materials will be posted at [[Meta:Image filter referendum]] shortly.

Sorry for delivering you a message in English. Please help translate the pages on the referendum on Meta and join the [[mail:translators-l|translators mailing list]].

Hello,
 
The Wikimedia Foundation is discussing changes to its Terms of Use.  The discussion can be found at [[m:Talk:Terms of use|Talk:Terms of use]]. Everyone is invited to join in. Because the new version of [[m:Terms of use|Terms of use]] is not in final form, we are not able to present official translations of it. Volunteers are welcome to translate it, as German volunteers have done at [[:m:Terms of use/de]], but we ask that you note at the top that the translation is unofficial and may become outdated as the English version is changed.

== Announcing Wikipedia 1.19 beta ==

Wikimedia Foundation is getting ready to push out 1.19 to all the WMF-hosted wikis.  As we finish wrapping up our code review, you can test the new version ''right now'' on [http://beta.wmflabs.org/ beta.wmflabs.org].  For more information, please read the [https://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/RELEASE-NOTES-1.19?view=markup release notes] or the [[mw:MediaWiki_1.19|start of the final announcement]].

The following are the areas that you will probably be most interested in:
* [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33711#c2 Faster loading of javascript files makes dependency tracking more important.]
* New common*.css files usable by skins instead of having to copy piles of generic styles from MonoBook or Vector's css.
* The default user signature now contains a talk link in addition to the user link.
* Searching blocked usernames in block log is now clearer.
* Better timezone recognition in user preferences.
* Improved diff readability for colorblind people.
* The interwiki links table can now be accessed also when the interwiki cache is used (used in the API and the Interwiki extension).
* More gender support (for instance in logs and user lists).
* Language converter improved, e.g. it now works depending on the page content language.
* Time and number-formatting magic words also now depend on the page content language.
* Bidirectional support further improved after 1.18.

Report any [http://labs.wikimedia.beta.wmflabs.org/wiki/Problem_reports problems] on the labs beta wiki and we'll work to address them before they software is released to the production wikis.

'''Note''' that this cluster does have SUL but it is not integrated with SUL in production, so you'll need to create another account.  You should avoid using the same password as you use here.  — [[m:Global message delivery|Global message delivery]] 16:28, 15 Eneru 2012 (UTC)

==Language support group for Pampanga==
The Wikimedia Foundation has brought together a new team of developers who are dedicated to language support. This team is to support all the languages and consequently it is not realistic to expect that the team members can provide proper support for your language. It is for this reason that we are looking for volunteers who will make up a [[:translatewiki:language support team|language support team]]. 

This language support team will be asked to provide us with information about their language. Such information may need to be provided either to us or on a website that we will indicate to you. Another activity will be to test software that will likely have an effect on the running of the MediaWiki software. We are looking for people who clearly identify their ability. Formal knowledge is definitely appreciated.

As much of the activity will be concentrated on [[:translatewiki:Main Page|translatewiki.net]], it will be a plus when team members know how to localise at translatewiki.net. <br>

== MediaWiki 1.19 ==

(Apologies if this message isn't in your language.) The Wikimedia Foundation is planning to upgrade MediaWiki (the software powering this wiki) to its latest version this month. You can help to test it before it is enabled, to avoid disruption and breakage. More information is available [[:mw:MediaWiki 1.19/Deployment announcement|in the full announcement]].

== Update on IPv6 ==

[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|right]]
(Apologies if this message isn't in your language. Please consider translating it, as well as '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement on Meta]]''') 

The Wikimedia Foundation is planning to do limited testing of IPv6 on June 2-3. If there are not too many problems, we may fully enable IPv6 on [http://www.worldipv6day.org/ World IPv6 day] (June 6), and keep it enabled.

What this means for your project:

*At least on June 2-3, 2012, you may see a small number of edits from IPv6 addresses, which are in the form "<code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code>". See e.g. [[w:en:IPv6 address]]. These addresses should behave like any other IP address: You can leave messages on their talk pages; you can track their contributions; you can block them. (See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement]] for notes on range blocks.)

*In the mid term, some user scripts and tools will need to be adapted for IPv6. 

*We suspect that IPv6 usage is going to be very low initially, meaning that abuse should be manageable, and we will assist in the monitoring of the situation.

Read [[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement]] on how to test the behavior of IPv6 with various tools and how to leave bug reports, and to find a fuller analysis of the implications of the IPv6 migration.

== 2011 Picture of the Year competition ==

Dear Wikimedians,

Wikimedia Commons is happy to announce that the ''2011 Picture of the Year competition'' is now open. We are interested in your opinion as to which images qualify to be the ''Picture of the Year 2011''. Any user registered at Commons or a Wikimedia wiki SUL-related to Commons [//toolserver.org/~pathoschild/accounteligibility/?user=&wiki=&event=24 with more than 75 edits before 1 April 2012 (UTC)] is welcome to vote and, of course everyone is welcome to view!

Detailed information about the contest can be found [[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Introduction|at the introductory page]].

About 600 of the best of Wikimedia Common's photos, animations, movies and graphics were chosen &ndash;by the international Wikimedia Commons community&ndash; out of 12 million files during ''2011'' and are now called ''Featured Pictures''.

From professional animal and plant shots to breathtaking panoramas and skylines, restorations of historically relevant images, images portraying the world's best architecture, maps, emblems, diagrams created with the most modern technology, and impressive human portraits, Commons ''Features Pictures'' of all flavors.  

For your convenience, we have sorted the images [[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Galleries|into topic categories]]. 

We regret that you receive this message in English; we intended to use banners to notify you in your native language but there was both, human and technical resistance.

See you on Commons!

==VisualEditor coming to this wiki==
Hello. Please excuse the English. I would be grateful if you can translate this message!

VisualEditor is coming to this project on December 2, 2013. VisualEditor is software in development to allow people to edit pages in MediaWiki without needing to learn wikitext syntax (like typing <nowiki>[[</nowiki> to start a link). It is already available and in use on some Wikipedia projects. Please see [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/FAQ]] for more information.

When this software arrives, you will have the option to use it or to use the current wikitext editor. When you press “edit”, you will get the new VisualEditor software. To use the wikitext editor, you can press “edit source”. For more information about how to use VisualEditor, see [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User guide]].

We hope that this software will be useful to people in your community, and we can really use your help to make it better! Please let us know if you find any problems. If you're willing and able, please [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/How to report a bug|report the issue in bugzilla]] in the [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=VisualEditor&format=guided "VisualEditor" product]. If you would prefer not, please explain the issue you found on the [[mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|central feedback page]] on mediawiki.org. Once VisualEditor is made available, if there are any urgent problems, like an unexpected bug suddenly causing widespread severe problems, please e-mail James Forrester, the Product Manager, at jforrester@wikimedia.org for immediate attention.

We would also appreciate help with translation with the pages about VisualEditor here and on MediaWiki.org, and its user interface. To translate the user interface, start by creating an account at [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Special%3AFirstSteps&type=on TranslateWiki]. Once your account request is approved, all you need to do is select your language from [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-visualeditor#sortable:3=desc this list]. This will give you a list of individual lines and paragraphs. The English original will be on one side, with the option to “edit” on the other. Pressing “edit” will open an edit window where you can work.

The User Guide is another important document.  To translate this, simply go to [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User_guide|the MediaWiki.org page]], and select “translate this page”.  Your language should be available from the drop-down menu on the right.  If you want to help with translations and would like to talk about how, please leave a message for me on my talk page.

Thank you, and happy editing! --[[User:Mdennis (WMF)|Mdennis (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Mdennis (WMF)|talk]]) 19:46, 19 Nobiembri 2013 (UTC)

== Translation of WMF's Vision to Kapampangan ==

Hi Kapampangan Wikipedias,  could you please make a translation of the WMF's vision into Kapampangan?  Here's the WMF's vision:

:''Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. That's our commitment.''

Thanks in advance. --[[User:Jojit fb|Jojit fb]] ([[User talk:Jojit fb|pamisabi-sabi]]) 08:27, 1 Setyembri 2017 (UTC)

Hello '''''Everyone''''',

'''[[:meta:Wikipedia Philippine Month|Wikipedia Philippine Month]]''' or simply '''Wikipedia PH Month''' is a monthly editing activity inspired by [[:meta:Wikipedia Asian Month|Wikipedia Asian Month]]. It aims to bridge knowledge gaps on Philippine content in Philippine language editions of Wikipedia and beyond. The participating community is not limited to the Philippines and is open to all Wikipedia editions! This activity also aims to encourage collaboration among Filipino contributors within the archipelago and in the diaspora, and create linkages among Filipino and non-Filipino contributors who support the main objective.

=== How to Participate in the Activity === 
'''As an Editor''' 
* Find the language edition of Wikipedia you would like to build on.
* Register an account if you have not done so.
* Choose articles about the Topic of the Month, but NOT from YOUR NATIVE LOCALITY, and start creating or improving articles.
* Write in the summary box the hashtag '''''#WikiPHmonth''''' before saving your work.

'''As an Organizer'''
* Set up and run the contest on a local level within your language community. (e.g. [[:bcl:Wikipedia:Wikipedia Philippine Month 2021]])
* If your local Wikipedia is already participating, ask if you can help judge articles if you are interested.
* Engage local editors and aim for maximum participation.
* Organize online and offline events for contest promotion and increase in participation.
* If you have expertise or skills in [[:en:public relations|public relations]], then you can help us get media coverage.

=== Topics ===
[[File:TribalPhilippinesTraditionalRange.png|thumb| <!--T:4--> Traditional homelands of the '''[[:en:indigenous peoples of the Philippines|indigenous peoples of the Philippines]]'''|alt=|250px]]
Each participating local Wikipedia community runs a monthly online edit-a-thon, which promotes the creation or improvement of the Wikipedia content about a particular group or [[:en:Ethnic groups in the Philippines|groups of people in the Philippines]] and the region they represent. 

* '''JANUARY''' - The '''[[:en:Visayans|Visayans]]''' (Region VI, Region VII, Region VIII, Romblon) are a metaethnicity race native to the whole [[:en:Visayas|Visayas]], to the southernmost islands of Luzon (MIMAROPA Region and Masbate) and the northern and eastern coastal parts of Mindanao. They are speakers of one or more Visayan languages, the most widely spoken being ''Cebuano, Hiligaynon'' and ''Waray-Waray''. They comprise the largest ethnic group in the nation. 
* '''February''' - Wiki Loves Love; Chinese New Year - [[:en:Chinese Filipino|Filipino-Chinese heritage]]  
* '''March''' - WikiGap; Women's Month - [[:en:Filipina|Filipina]]
* '''APRIL''' - The '''[[:en:Tagalogs|Tagalogs]]''' (NCR, Region IV-A, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Marinduque) are the most widespread ethnic group in the Philippines. They predominate the entirety of the [[:en:Manila|Manila]] and mainland [[:en:CALABARZON|southern Luzon regions]], with a plurality in [[:en:Central Luzon|Central Luzon]] (mainly in its southeastern portion, as well as parts of Zambales and Bataan provinces except for Pampanga and Tarlac) and coastal parts of Mindoro. The Tagalog language was chosen as an official language of the Philippines in 1935. Today, Filipino, a de facto version of Tagalog, is taught throughout the archipelago. 
* '''MAY''' - Heritage Month - '''[[:en:Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines#Highland_Ethnolinguistic_Nations|Highland Ethnolinguistic Nations]]''' (Cordilleras), '''Mangyan''' (in central Mindoro island), '''Suludnon''' (in central Panay island, and '''Negritos''' (in remote areas throughout Luzon, Panay, Negros islands, and Mindanao). The ''[[:en:Igorot|Igorots/Cordillerans]]'' live in the highlands of Luzon. They are primarily located in the [[:en:Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera Administrative Region]], Caraballo Mountains, and Sierra Madre. ''[[:en:Mangyan|Mangyan]]'' is the generic name for the eight indigenous groups found on the island of Mindoro, southwest of the island of Luzon in the Philippines, each with its own tribal name, language, and customs. They occupy nearly the whole of the interior of the island of Mindoro. The ''[[:en:Negrito|Negrito]]'' are several Australo-Melanesian groups who inhabit isolated parts of Southeast Asia. They all live in remote areas throughout the islands in the Philippines. The ''[[:en:Suludnon|Suludnon]]'', also known as the Tumandok, Sulod, Panay-Bukidnon, or Panayanon Sulud, are an indigenous Visayan group of people who reside in the Capiz-Lambunao mountainous area and the Antique-Iloilo mountain area of central Panay in the Visayan islands of the Philippines.
* '''June''' - Filipino-Spanish Friendship Day - [[:en:Spanish Filipino|Filipino-Spanish heritage]] 
* '''JULY''' - The '''[[:en:Ilocano people|Ilocanos]]''' and minorities in '''[[:en:Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines#Lowland_Ethnolinguistic_Nations|Lowland Ethnolinguistic Nations]]''' in [[:en:Cagayan Valley Region|Cagayan Valley Region]] (Region I, Region II) are predominantly Christian group who reside within the lowlands and coastal areas of [[:en:Ilocos Region|northwestern Luzon]]. Other Ilocanos are also found in Cordillera Administrative Region and Cagayan Valley. The ''Ivatan'' (also spelled as Ibatan) are the predominant ethnolinguistic group in the [[:en:Batanes|Batanes]] islands of the Philippines. They have close cultural links with the Taiwanese aborigines, especially the Yami/Tao people of Orchid Island under jurisdiction of Taiwan. The ''Ibanags'' are a predominantly Christian lowland ethnic group numbering around half a million people and who primarily inhabit the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela in the Cagayan Valley of northern Luzon. The ''Itawes''/Itawis/Itawit are among the earliest inhabitants of the [[:en:Cagayan Valley|Cagayan Valley]] in northern Luzon. The ''Gaddang'' number about 25,000. They are known to have inhabited the upper Cagayan Valley and the Magat valley below Aritao in Nueva Vizcaya and in [[:en:Isabela|Isabela]] since before the Spanish arrived. 
* '''AUGUST''' - Indigenous Month - '''[[:en:Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines#Highland_Ethnolinguistic_Nations|Highland Ethnolinguistic Nations]]''' (Tribal Palaweño, and Lumad) and '''[[:en:Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines#Lowland_Ethnolinguistic_Nations|Lowland Ethnolinguistic Nations]]''' ([[:en:Bangsamoro|Bangsamoro]]). The ''[[:en:peoples of Palawan|peoples and tribes of Palawan]]'' are a diverse group of both indigenous tribes and lowland groups that historically migrated to the island of Palawan and its outlying islands. The ''[[:en:Lumad|Lumad]]'' are the un-Islamized and un-Christianized indigenous Austronesian peoples of Mindanao. They include several ethnolinguistic nations such as the Manobo, the Tasaday, the Mamanwa, the Mandaya, the B'laan, the T'boli, and the Kalagan. They primarily inhabit the eastern parts of Mindanao such as the Caraga, and Davao Regions. The collective term ''[[:en:Moro people|Moro]]'' or Bangsamoro people refers to the, at least 13, islamicized ethnolinguistic groups of Mindanao, Sulu and Palawan. The Muslim Moros originally had a few independent states such as the Maguindanao Sultanate, the Lanao Sultanates, and the Sulu Sultanate. The Sultanate of Sulu once exercised sovereignty over the present day provinces of Basilan, Palawan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, the eastern part of the Malaysian state of Sabah (formerly North Borneo) and North Kalimantan in Indonesia.
*'''SEPTEMBER''' - The '''[[:en:Bicolano people|Bikolanos]]''' and '''[[:en:Masbateño people|Masbateños]]''' (Region V) are a predominantly Roman Catholic ethnic group that originates from the Bicol Region in Southern Luzon. They are the fifth-largest ethnolinguistic group in the Philippines. ''Masbateños'' live in Masbate province of the Philippines. Masbateños may be considered Visayans by language but are Bicolanos by region.
* '''OCTOBER''' - The '''[[:en:Pangasinan people|Pangasinan]]''' and '''[[:en:Bolinao language|Bolinaos]]''' (Pangasinan) are the eighth-largest ethnolinguistic group in the Philippines.

The ''Bolinao'' people live in Bolinao and Anda, Pangasinan. They speak the Bolinao language or Binubolinao, which is the second most widely spoken Sambalic language in Pangasinan (after Sambal).
* '''November''' - Wikipedia Asian Month - [[:en:Asian people|Asian Heritage]] 
* '''DECEMBER''' - The '''[[:en:Kapampangan people|Kapampangans]]''' and '''[[:en:Sambal people|Sambals]]''' (Pampanga, Zambales, Tarlac) are the seventh-largest ethnic group in the Philippines. They primarily use the Kapampangan language, which is spoken by more than 1.4 million individuals. The ''Sambals'' are the inhabitants of the province of Zambales, including the independent city of Olongapo. They are also found in the municipalities of Bolinao and Anda in northwestern Pangasinan. Sambals currently make up a large proportion of the population in the Zambales municipalities of north of Iba, the provincial capital. Their language, Sambal, is related to Kapampangan.

== Universal Code of Conduct – 2021 consultations ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== Universal Code of Conduct Phase 2 ===

{{int:please-translate}}

The [[:wmf:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct|'''Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC)''']] provides a universal baseline of acceptable behavior for the entire Wikimedia movement and all its projects. The project is currently in Phase 2, outlining clear enforcement pathways. You can read more about the whole project on its [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct|'''project page''']].

==== Drafting Committee: Call for applications ====

The Wikimedia Foundation is recruiting volunteers to join a committee to draft how to make the code enforceable. Volunteers on the committee will commit between 2 and 6 hours per week from late April through July and again in October and November. It is important that the committee be diverse and inclusive, and have a range of experiences, including both experienced users and newcomers, and those who have received or responded to, as well as those who have been falsely accused of harassment.

To apply and learn more about the process, see [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee|Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee]].

==== 2021 community consultations: Notice and call for volunteers / translators ====

From 5 April – 5 May 2021 there will be conversations on many Wikimedia projects about how to enforce the UCoC. We are looking for volunteers to translate key material, as well as to help host consultations on their own languages or projects using suggested [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations/Discussion|key questions]]. If you are interested in volunteering for either of these roles, please [[:m:Talk:Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations|contact us]] in whatever language you are most comfortable.

To learn more about this work and other conversations taking place, see [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations|Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations]].

== Line numbering coming soon to all wikis ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">  

[[File:Technical_Wishes_–_Line_numbering_-_2010_wikitext_editor.png|thumb|Example]]
From April 15, you can enable line numbering in some wikitext editors - for now in the template namespace, coming to more namespaces soon. This will make it easier to detect line breaks and to refer to a particular line in discussions. These numbers will be shown if you enable the syntax highlighting feature ([[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:CodeMirror|CodeMirror extension]]), which is supported in the [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:WikiEditor|2010]] and [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/2017 wikitext editor|2017]] wikitext editors. 

More information can be found on [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes/Line Numbering|this project page]]. Everyone is invited to test the feature, and to give feedback [[m:talk:WMDE Technical Wishes/Line Numbering|on this talk page]].

== Suggested Values ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">  

From April 29, it will be possible to suggest values for parameters in templates. Suggested values can be added to [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] and will then be shown as a drop-down list in [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:VisualEditor/User guide|VisualEditor]]. This allows template users to quickly select an appropriate value. This way, it prevents potential errors and reduces the effort needed to fill the template with values. It will still be possible to fill in values other than the suggested ones.

More information, including the supported parameter types and how to create suggested values: [[mw:Help:TemplateData#suggestedvalues|[1]]] [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Suggested_values_for_template_parameters|[2]]].

== Invitation for Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos 2021 ==

Hello there,

We are inviting you to participate in '''[[:m:Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos 2021|Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos 2021]]''', a global contest scheduled to run from July through August 2021.

Participants will choose among Wikipedia pages without photo images, then add a suitable file from among the many thousands of photos in the Wikimedia Commons, especially those uploaded from thematic contests (Wiki Loves Africa, Wiki Loves Earth, Wiki Loves Folklore, etc.) over the years.

In its first year (2020), 36 Wikimedia communities in 27 countries joined the campaign. Events relating to the campaign included training organized by at least 18 Wikimedia communities in 14 countries.

The campaign resulted in the addition of media files (photos, audios and videos) to more than 90,000 Wikipedia articles in 272 languages.

Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos (WPWP) offers an ideal task for recruiting and guiding new editors through the steps of adding content to existing pages. Besides individual participation, the WPWP campaign can be used by user groups and chapters to organize editing workshops and edit-a-thons.

The organizing team is looking for a contact person to coordinate WPWP participation at the Wikimedia user group or chapter level (geographically or thematically) or for a language WP. We’d be glad for you to reply to this message, or sign up directly at [[:m:Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos 2021/Participating Communities#Wikimedia affiliate communities|WPWP Participating Communities]].

Please feel free to contact [[:m:Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos 2021/Organizing Team|Organizing Team]] if you have any query.

Kind regards,<br/>

The organizing team is looking for a contact person to coordinate WPWP participation at the Wikimedia user group or chapter level (geographically or thematically) or for a language WP. We’d be glad for you to reply to this message, or sign up directly at [[:m:Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos 2021/Participating Communities#Wikimedia affiliate communities|WPWP Participating Communities]].

Please feel free to contact [[:m:Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos 2021/Organizing Team|Organizing Team]] if you have any query.

Kind regards,<br/>

== Wikimania 2021: Individual Program Submissions ==

[[File:Wikimania logo with text 2.svg|right|200px]]
Dear all,

Wikimania 2021 will be [[:wikimania:2021:Save the date and the Core Organizing Team|hosted virtually]] for the first time in the event's 15-year history. Since there is no in-person host, the event is being organized by a diverse group of Wikimedia volunteers that form the [[:wikimania:2021:Organizers|Core Organizing Team]] (COT) for Wikimania 2021.

'''Event Program''' - Individuals or a group of individuals can submit their session proposals to be a part of the program. There will be translation support for sessions provided in a number of languages. See more information [[:wikimania:2021:Submissions/Guidelines#Language Accessibility|here]].

Below are some links to guide you through;
* [[:wikimania:2021:Submissions|Program Submissions]]
* [[:wikimania:2021:Submissions/Guidelines|Session Submission Guidelines]]
* [[:wikimania:2021:FAQ|FAQ]]

Please note that the deadline for submission is 18th June 2021. 

'''Announcements'''- To keep up to date with the developments around Wikimania, the COT sends out weekly updates. You can view them in the Announcement section [[:wikimania:2021:Announcements|here]]. 

'''Office Hour''' - If you are left with questions, the COT will be hosting some office hours (in multiple languages), in multiple time-zones, to answer any programming questions that you might have.  Details can be found [[:wikimania:2021:Organizers#Office hours schedule|here.]]

Best regards,

[[File:Reply Tool A-B test comment completion.png|alt=Junior contributors comment completion rate across all participating Wikipedias|thumb|296x296px|When newcomers had the Reply tool and tried to post on a talk page, they were more successful at posting a comment. ([https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ Source])]]

Earlier this year, the Editing team ran a large study of [[mw:Talk pages project/Replying|the Reply Tool]].  The main goal was to find out whether the Reply Tool helped [[mw:Talk pages project/Glossary|newer editors]] communicate on wiki.  The second goal was to see whether the comments that newer editors made using the tool needed to be reverted more frequently than comments newer editors made with the existing wikitext page editor.

The key results were:

* Newer editors who had automatic ("default on") access to the Reply tool were [https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ more likely] to post a comment on a talk page.
* The comments that newer editors made with the Reply Tool were also [https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ less likely] to be reverted than the comments that newer editors made with page editing.

These results give the Editing team confidence that the tool is helpful.

<strong>Looking ahead</strong>

The team is planning to make the Reply tool available to everyone as an opt-out preference in the coming months.  This has already happened at the Arabic, Czech, and Hungarian Wikipedias.

The next step is to [[phab:T280599|resolve a technical challenge]]. Then, they will deploy the Reply tool first to the [[phab:T267379|Wikipedias that participated in the study]].  After that, they will deploy it, in stages, to the other Wikipedias and all WMF-hosted wikis.

You can turn on "{{int:discussiontools-preference-label}}" [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|in Beta Features]] now.  After you get the Reply tool, you can change your preferences at any time in [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-editing-discussion]].
