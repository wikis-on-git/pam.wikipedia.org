'''Hammana''' is a town in [[Lebanon]], about 26 km East of [[Beirut]].
Ing '''Hammana''' metung yang balen king [[Lebanon]], a maki dayung 26 km king [[aslagan]] ning [[Beirut]].

It is in the [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]] in the district (or Caza) of [[Baabda District|Baabda]]. Nearby is the town of Mdeyrig.
Atiu king [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]] king distritu (o Caza) ning [[Baabda District|Baabda]]. 

The word "Hammana" may have come from the name of the Phoenician Sun God "Hammon" or "Hamman". These two names are derived from the word "Hama" which means heat of the sun.
Hammana is located on the west of [[Mount Lebanon]] mountain chain, at an altitude of 1200m.  This gives it four seasons, making it an attractive resort, including cool summers and snow in winter.
Mapaliaring ing katayang "Hammana" ibat ya king dios ning aldo ning Fenicia, i "Hammon" o "Hamman". Ibat la reng aduang lagiung deti king katayang "Hama", a mangabaldugang pali ning aldo.

Hammana has given the world great humanitarian persons, among them we name the doctor [[Ma Haide (George Hatem)]] who helped save [[China]] from many diseases of the new age, and who was honored by naming the square in the front the town's square after him.
