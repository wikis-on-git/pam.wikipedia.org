Ing[[boxing|boxingeru]], a taga [[Syudad General Santos]], [[Fiiipinas]] a kebaluan mu rin bilang "The Destroyer" kareng kayang kayabe keng boxing.  Inari no reng kayang laban kapamilatan ning kayang tumbuk keng kailing gamat.

Ing 27 banuang idad a Pacquiao megumpisa yang keng professional boxing inyang 1995 keng 106 libra. Miatas ya timbang manibat 106 anggang to 113 pounds before losing in his 12th fight against Rustico Torrecampo via third round technical knockout. Shortly after the Torrecampo fight Pacquiao settled in at 112 pounds, winning the WBC Flyweight title only to lose it in his second defense against [[Medgoen Singsurat]] by third round knockout. Theoretically speaking, Pacquiao may have lost the belt at the scales by not being able to make weight of 112 lb (51 kg).  

Following the loss to Singsurat, Pacquiao again jumped in weight, this time stopping at the Super Bantamweight division of 122 lb (55 kg) where he picked up the WBC International title, defending it five times before his next world title fight came.  Pacquiao’s big break came on [[June 23]]rd, [[2001]], against IBF Super Bantamweight  champion [[Lehlohonolo Ledwaba]]. Pacquiao stepped into the fight as a late replacement and walked out of the fight the newly crowned IBF Super Bantamweight champion. Pacquiao scored three knockdowns before the end of the fight was called in the fifth round.

Manny went on to defend his title four times before the match that many consider to have defined his career, against his childhood boxing idol, [[Marco Antonio Barrera]] of [[Mexico]] came. Pacquiao rose from an official knockdown in the first round, and won the fight by technical knockout, when Barrera’s corner stopped the fight in the eleventh round. With this victory, the "Pacman" captured the [[WBO]] and [[Ring Magazine]] People's Featherweight Title, as Barrera had beaten [[Naseem Hamed]] previously for that belt.  Pacquiao's performance established himself, according to many critics, fans and boxing magazines alike, as one of the best pound-for-pound boxers in the world, and put the Philippines on the boxing world's map again where he follows in the footsteps of past Filipino boxing stars such as "[[Flash Elorde]]", [[Ben Villaflor]], and [[Pancho Villa (boxer)|Pancho Villa]], among others.

Only six months removed from his win over Marco Antonio Barrera. Pacquiao went on to challenge another respected Mexican boxer, [[Juan Manuel Marquez]], holder of the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] and IBF Featherweight Title.  Experts predicted that Marquez, a dangerous counter-puncher, would prevail over Pacquiao because of his apparently superior boxing skills.  The fight turned out to be one of the greatest Featherweight clashes in the history of boxing.  Pacquiao's handspeed and punching power was displayed early as he stormed Marquez with jabs and straight lefts that sent the Mexican Champion to the canvas  three times in the first round alone.  It looked as if Pacquiao was on his way to a quick victory, but things changed as Marquez started to take control in the second, arguably dominating the fight and getting better with each passing round. When the bell to end the 12th round sounded, the fight was scored a draw (tie). 

Against Fahsan (3K-Battery) Por Thawatchai, Pacquiao sent Por Thawatchai to the canvas three times en route to a knock out in the fourth-round. A left uppercut to the jaw knocked down the Thai fighter with both feet off the canvas and ended the fight.

Pacquiao once again jumped in weight, this time to the Super Featherwight division and squared off against former three-time division champion [[Erik Morales]] on [[March 19|19th of March]], [[2005]]. However, Pacquiao lost the 12 round match with a unanimous decision from the judges. Pacquiao had to fight with a cut in his eye for most of the fight against Morales. Despite the loss, Pacquiao gained further credibility as a fighter who could fight back under adversity.

On [[September 10]], [[2005]], Manny Pacquiao knocked out [[Hector Velazquez]], capturing the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] International Super Featherweight Title in the process.

Pacquiao defeated [[Erik Morales]] by TKO in a rematch on [[January 21]], [[2006]] in [[Las Vegas]] at [[Thomas and Mack Center]], [[United States]].  Pacquiao nearly dropped Morales in round two and wobbled him again in the sixth. Pacquiao floored Morales twice in round 10 before the fight was stopped at 2:33. It was the first time the 29-year-old Morales, a former world champion in three weight classes, was stopped in his career. With this win Pacquiao is now ranked the top contender in the WBC superfeatherweight rankings and is now eligible to face [[Marco Antonio Barrera]] again for the WBC Belt. A third fight with Morales is possible but the future for it is unclear.
