The following is a partial '''list of adjectival forms of place names''' in [[English (language)|English]] and their [[demonym]]ic equivalents, which denote the people or the inhabitants of the places.

Note: [[Demonyms]] are given in plural forms. Singular forms simply remove the final 's' or, in the case of ''-ese'' endings, are the same as the plural forms.  
The ending ''-men'' has [[grammatical gender|feminine]] equivalent ''-women'' (e.g. ''an Irishman and a Scotswoman''). The [[French language|French]] terminations ''-ois'' / ''ais'' serve as both the singular and plural [[grammatical gender|masculine]]; adding 'e' (''-oise'' / ''aise'') makes them singular feminine; 'es' (''-oises'' / ''aises'') makes them plural feminine. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] termination "-o" usually denotes the [[grammatical gender|masculine]] and is normally changed to [[grammatical gender|feminine]] by dropping the "-o" and adding "-a". The plural forms are usually "-os" and "-as" respectively.

Adjectives ending ''-ish'' can be used as collective demonyms (e.g. ''the English, the Cornish'').  So can those ending in ''-ch'' / ''-tch'' (e.g. ''the French'', ''the Dutch'') provided they are pronounced with a 'ch' sound (e.g. the adjective ''Czech'' does not qualify).

Where an adjective is a link, the link is to the [[language]] or [[dialect]] of the same name. (Reference: [http://www.ethnologue.org/ Ethnologue, Languages of the World])

Many place-name adjectives and many demonyms refer also to various other things, sometimes with and sometimes without one or more additional words.  (Sometimes, the use of one or more additional words is optional.)  Notable examples are [[list of cheeses|cheeses]], [[list of cat breeds|cat breeds]], [[list of dog breeds|dog breeds]], and [[list of horse breeds|horse breeds]].
