The numerous gorges in the neighboring rocks have been taken advantage of to surround the city with a series of lakes, which, shaded by trees and bordered by crags, add much greenery to the suburbs. However, many of these lakes now have been encroached upon for the purpose of fishing or for building works, although greenery still exists.

The city itself dates from the nineteenth century, and is laid out in wide and regular streets. It has a beautiful collection of [[Marble Rocks]] called [[Bhedaghat]] surrounding the holy [[Narmada River]]<ref name=autogenerated11>[http://www.jabalpurcity.com/ JabalpurCity, Jabalpur city, Jabalpurcity.com, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, M.P.

==Origin of Name==
[[Jabalpur]] was previously known as Jabalipuram during the [[British Raj]]<ref>[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/JEE_JUN/JUBBULPORE_or_JABALPUR.html JUBBULPORE, or JABALPUR - Online Information article about JUBBULPORE, or JABALPUR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.
 

According to local belief Sage Jabali apparently lived in the area during the Ramayana era and puram is the sanskrit word for city.  Hence the name Jabalipuram, the city of Rishi(sage) Jabali.

==History==
It is believed that Jabalpur is the ''tapasya bhumi'' of a mythological figure known as sage Jabalie, from whom the name Jabalpur is derived. [[Ashoka]]n relics have been found. Later on it was the capital of the famous [[Tripuri kingdom]] ([[9th century|9th]]–[[10th century|10th centuries]]). 

In AD 875, it was taken over by the [[Kalachuri]] dynasty who made Jabalpur their capital. In the 13th century, the [[Gond]]s seized it and made it their capital. Inscriptions record the existence during the [[11th century|11th]] and [[12th century|12th centuries]] of a local line of princes of the [[Haihai]] people who are closely connected with the history of [[Gondwana (India)|Gondwana]]. 

[[Image:Jabalpur, India - Madan Mahal, c.1865.jpg|thumb|Madan Mahal, the palace of [[Durgavati|Rani Durgavati]] in Jabalpur, c.1865.]]In the [[16th century]] the [[Gond]] raja of [[Garha-Mandla]] extended his power over fifty-two districts, including the present Jabalpur. During the minority of his grandson, Asaf Khan, the viceroy of Kara Manikpur, conquered the Garha principality and held it at first as an independent chief. Eventually he submitted to the [[Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]]. From time to time, the Mughal rulers tried to overrun it. The legendary Gond Queen [[Durgavati|Rani Durgavati]] also died fighting the Mughal forces led by the great Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]]. 

The [[Mughal Empire]], however, enjoyed little more than a nominal supremacy; and the princes of Garha-Mandla maintained a practical independence until their subjugation by the [[Maratha]] governors of [[Sagar]] in [[1781]]. In [[1798]] the Maratha [[Peshwa]] granted the Narmada valley to the [[Bhonsle]] princes of [[Nagpur]], who continued to hold the district until the British occupied it in [[1818]] after defeating the Marathas. The British made Jabalpur the commission headquarters of the Narmada territories and established a cantonment here. 

Under the British ''Raj'', Jabalpur became the capital of the [[Saugor and Nerbudda Territories]], which was part of the British [[North-Western Province]]. At that time it became infamous for the ''[[Thuggee]]'' murderers, but made more famous by the man who suppressed thugee, Col. [[William Henry Sleeman|Sleeman]], who was also appointed commissioner at Jabalpur. The Saugor and Nerbudda Territories became part of the new [[Central Provinces]] in [[1861]] which in [[1903]] became the [[Central Provinces and Berar]]. By the early 20th Century Jabalpur was the headquarters of a brigade in the 5th division of the Southern Army.

An important landmark event was the holding of the Tripuri Congress session in [[1939]] that was presided over by [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]. 
Politically under [[Lokmanya Tilak]]'s direction Jhanda Satyagraha was launched with success (who visited 3 times) [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited 4 times and famous Congress session was held at Tripuri (Jabalpur) in [[1939]] when [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] was elected the Congress President against the wishes of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Methodology of two thoughts to achieve freedom was formulated in the session. A memorial Kamania gate was erected in city. 

After India's independence in [[1947]], the [[Central Provinces and Berar]] became the Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]].

==Geography==
Jabalpur is located at {{coor d|23.17|N|79.95|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/35/Jabalpur.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Jabalpur]</ref> It has an average elevation of 411&nbsp;[[metre]]s (1348&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]]).

The map of Jabalpur can be seen here at <ref>[http://mapmyindia.com/index.html?app=&q%3Dmap%26addr%3Djabalpur%26sta%3DMP&x=-1111892&y=5575669&z=7&licKey=ed24f1c04c6562b128091ad1a7ec58e2 Jabalpur on MapmyIndia.com]</ref>

==Topography==

The exceptional [[Topography]] of Jabalpur with hills all around the city gives it a picturesque setting. Some of the [[Hindi]] movies like jis desh main ganga behti hai, ashoka etc. have been shot here. The picturesque setting though is a nightmare for town planners and developers. The [[Central Railways]] has constructed railway lines winding along these hills, somewhat akin to a horseshoe. A railway journey to the city is a singular experience with beatific old world charm.

The hills of Jabalpur, with varied mineral content are the preferred destination for [[Geologists]] and [[Archeologists]]. [[Paleontologists]], with the finding of a fossilized [[Dinosaur]], come in hordes looking for some more clues on the world before the last [[Ice Age]].

==Climate==

The city has the typical hot and dry temperate of the [[Great Indian Plateau]]. Jabalpur is hot during [[summers]] with temperatures up to 47 degree Celsius but the [[winters]] are quite comfortable. The July to September months bring heavy rains with the onset of the South Western monsoon. The October to March window during the winters is suitable for a visit to the city.

==Economy==

Jabalpur district with River [[Narmada]] bringing in fresh water from the [[Vindyachal]] Ranges has developed into an [[agrarian]] economy. The land of the [[Narmada]] basin with its fertile [[alluvial]] soil gives good yields of sorghum, wheat, rice and millets in the villages around Jabalpur. The State of Madhya Pradesh is the largest producer of Soybeans and the district of Jabalpur occupies a place of pride in agriculture production.

Important among commercial crops are pulses, oilseeds, cotton, sugar cane and medicinal crops. The state is poised for a breakthrough in soybean cultivation. In the state [[Kharif]] crops occupy 60% and [[Rabi]] crops 40% area with 71.4% area under food grain production. Nearly 59% of landholders are marginal whereas small farmers share 18% of farmland. Low literacy (35.45%), undulating topography, large waste land (13.2%), under developed irrigation potential (23%), low ground water utilization, large proportion of rain fed agriculture (75%), practice of [[Kharif]] fallows (3.6%), low cropping intensity (131%), low fertilizer consumption (50 kg/ha), high proportion of low value crops, and high population of low productive live stock are the major constraints of the state. 

Jabalpur has a variety of Industries too. Most of these have their bases in mineral substances of economic value found in the district. Ready-made garments industry is one of the most popular and profitable business in Jabalpur. Bidi manufacturing, lime stone related industries, Electrical goods, Saw mills, Food Processing Industries are the major business areas in this region. Some other industries are Telephone Parts, Furniture, Building Materials, Ammunitions and glassware.

The economy of Jabalpur primarily revolves around the [[Ordinance Factory]] and the Defence establishments started in the early 20th century. Jabalpur has four Ordinance Factories. The [[Gun Carriage Factory Jabalpur|Gun Carriage Factory]] was started in the year 1904 well equipped and manufacture gun parts, mounting , shells and a variety of the other product for war purpose. [[Vehicle Factory Jabalpur (VFJ)]]<ref name=autogenerated10>[http://ofbindia.gov.in/index.php?wh=ourunits Indian Ordnance Factories: Our Factories<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> was started as manufacturer of trucks named ''Shaktimann''. Other two are ''Grey Iron Foundry (GIF)'' and ''Ordinance Factory Khamaria (OFK)''<ref name=autogenerated10 />.

There are 7 Blocks in the district with 1449 inhabited villages, 60 uninhabited, 1209 revenue villages and 4 forest villages.

== Culture ==
The presence of the [[Narmada]] and the rule of [[Gond]] and [[Maratha]] dynasties has made Jabalpur a primarily Hindu dominated area.  The [[Mughal]] rule brought in a sizable [[Muslim]] population.  The city has seen the worst form of Hindu Muslim riots in the 60s.  The rise in the population of the city especially village folk migrating to the city are settling in slums on the outskirts of Jabalpur.  The estimates are that by the year 2015, the population of the city will double to a whopping two million people.  Moreover setting up of Central government units increased the population of the city and made it more cosmopolitan.

[[Hindi]] is the first language of the state and spoken and understood in the city.  The [[Mughals]] brought [[Urdu]] and the influence of [[Maratha]] rulers has given Marathi to the multilingual culture of Jabalpur.

== Transportation ==

Jabalpur is one of the major cities in [[Madhya Pradesh]] so transportation is not an issue here.

=== Air ===
[[Air Deccan]] is providing daily service on Jabalpur-Delhi-Luckhnow route & [[Kingfisher Airlines]] is also running daily flights bewteen Indore and Jabalpur,  connecting Nagpur and Hyderabad via Indore. [[Indian Airlines]] runs four days a week service on Delhi-Gwalior-Jabalpur route.

=== Road ===
Jabalpur is well connected to [[Nagpur]], [[Bhopal]], [[Allahabad]] and [[Jaipur]] so you can travel easily by roads also.  The city is connected with three National Highways
* NH-7 ([[Varanasi]]-[[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]])<ref>http://www.mapsofindia.com/driving-directions-maps/nh7-driving-directions-map.html/</ref>
* NH-12 ([[Jabalpur]]-[[Jaipur]])<ref>http://www.mapsofindia.com/driving-directions-maps/nh12-driving-directions-map.html/</ref>
* NH-12A ([[Simga]], [[Chattisgarh]]-NH-26 near [[Jhansi]]), <ref>http://www.india9.com/i9show/National-Highway-12A-65031.htm/</ref>

=== Railways ===
Jabalpur is the headquarter of [[West Central Railways]] and is well connected with mail and super-fast trains from [[Mumbai]], [[New Delhi]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Bhopal]], [[Kolkatta]], [[Patna]], [[Lucknow]], [[Chennai]], [[Bangalore]], [[Nagpur]], [[Kota]],[[Jaipur]],[[Jammu]]& [[Hyderabad]].  Apart from broad-gauge railways, Jabalpur is notable for having narrow-gauge railways (which connect with [[Gondia]]).  Work to convert this [[Gondia]]-[[Nainpur]]-[[Jabalpur]] narrow gauge <!-- metre gauge ?? --> to broad gauge has been started under [[Unigauge|Project Unigauge]] <ref> [[Railway Gazette International]] Supplement December 2007 p7 </ref> and will provide new opportunities as southern India will be reachable quickly.  This route will decrease the time taken by trains running from [[Delhi]] to [[Chennai]] by at least three hours.

=== Local Transport ===
Jabalpur, the city of marbles, is fast emerging as a centre of trade and commerce in the state of Madhya Pradesh. In the context of rapid growth of the city, increasing mobility, high travel demand, increasing intensity of traffic, congestion, delays, accidents and other such problems, public mass transport system of the city stands out as the most critical issue. The intra-city public transport system is essentially road based with 110 private mini buses and 250 tempos and 10000 auto rickshaws. Since there was no specialized and effective regulatory agency to monitor the system a special purpose vehicle in the form of public limited company ''Jabalpur City Transport Services Limited'' has been set up to operate and manage the public transport system in Jabalpur with PPP model to overcome financial constraints.<ref>[http://www.jabalpurcitytransport.com/ Jabalpur City Transport Services Limited<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Other than that ''Mini Buses'', ''Autos'', ''Tempos'' enable good and cheap transportation in the city.  ''Cycle Rickshaws'' are also helpful in local routes which are quite cheap and ecofriendly and constitute the main source of transportation.

*'''Bhedaghat - Marble Rocks'''.<ref name=autogenerated8>[http://www.travelmasti.com/domestic/mp/bhedaghat.htm Bhedaghat, Madhya Pradesh travel information guide, Dhuandhar Falls, places<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

This small village of Jabalpur district situated on the banks of river [[Narmada]] and widely famous for its marble rocks is at a distance about 25 km from Jabalpur by road. Soaring in glittering splendour, the marble rocks  at [[Bhedaghat]] rise to a hundred feet on either side of the Narmada. The serene loveliness of the scene is one of cool quiet, the sunlight sparkling on the marble-white pinnacles and casting dappled shadows on the pellucid waters. In his Highlands of [[Central India]] Captain J. Forsyth speaks eloquently about the infinitely varied beauty of the rocks 

''The eye never wearies of the . . . effect produced by the broken and reflected sunlight, now glancing from a pinnacle of snow-white marble reared against the deep blue of the sky as from a point of silver, touching here and there with bright lights the prominence of the middle heights and again losing itself in the soft bluish grays of their recesses.....Here and there the white saccharine limestone is seamed by veins of dark green or black volcanic rock; a contrast which only enhances like a setting of jet, the purity of the surrounding marble''

The famous [[waterfall]] is located just 25 km from Jabalpur. The [[Narmada]] making its way through the Marble Rock's narrows down and then plunges in a waterfall known as ''Dhuandhar'' or the smoke casade. So powerful is the plunge that its roar is heard from a far distance. The falls and the breaking of the volume of water at the crest present an awesome spectacle of Nature's power unleashed.

Sports Club of Jabalpur

==Snooker==

The game of [[Snooker]] was conceived in Jabalpur. Origins of the game of Snooker are generally regarded as being in the latter half of the 19th century. [[Billiards]] had been a popular activity amongst British army officers stationed in India who stole the idea from the Indian game [[Carrom]], and variations on the more traditional billiard games were devised. One variation was to add coloured balls in addition to the reds and black which were used for pyramid pool and life pool. This gave birth to the game of Snooker. Although snooker’s origin is not recorded explicitly, it is generally held that a Colonel Sir Neville Chamberlain (no relation to the World War II Prime Minister) conceived the game in the British Army Officer’s Mess in Jubbulpore, India, in 1875.<ref>[http://www.titansports.co.uk/history/snooker.htm The History of Snooker<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
