'''''Sister Act''''' is a 1992 [[United States|American]] [[comedy film]] released by [[Touchstone Pictures]]. Directed by [[Emile Ardolino]], it features musical arrangements by [[Marc Shaiman]] and stars [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as a [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] lounge singer who has been put under [[protective custody]] in a [[San Francisco]] [[convent]] and has to pretend to be a [[nun]] when a mob boss puts her on his hit list. Also in the cast are [[Maggie Smith]], [[Kathy Najimy]], [[Wendy Makkena]], [[Mary Wickes]], and [[Harvey Keitel]]. The film is #83 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''The 100 Funniest Movies'' list.

The film was followed by a 1993 sequel, ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]''. It also inspired [[Sister Act (musical)|a musical stage version]] that premiered at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in [[Pasadena, California]] in 2006, and opened at the [[London Palladium]] with previews from May 7, 2009.

==Plot==
The movie opens at a Catholic elementary school in 1968. There, a strict nun scolds a little girl named Deloris for giving sarcastic answers in class. The nun warns the girl that she will be doomed to a life of sin if she does not mend her ways.

In the present day, Deloris van Cartier ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]) is a lounge singer at a casino in [[Reno, Nevada]]. She is involved in a relationship with a married man, mobster Vincent "Vince" LaRocca ([[Harvey Keitel]]). Deloris is oblivious to his criminal activities, as he always keeps her out of his "business". After a fight, Vince tries to win Deloris' affection back with a beautiful purple mink coat, but she discovers that the coat belongs to Vince's wife. Furious, she decides to break up with Vince that night. She heads for Vince's office in the casino where she works, to return the coat and tell Vince she's leaving him. Meanwhile, Vince is in the office confronting his limo driver, whom he accuses of being a police informant. When Deloris walks in, she hears a shot and sees the limo driver dead on the floor. Vince's thugs, Willy ([[Richard Portnow]]) and Joey (Robert Miranda), are also present. They chase Deloris, but she escapes through the basement of the casino and disappears into the street, whereupon she takes a cab to the police station. Lieutenant Eddie Souther ([[Bill Nunn]]) hears her story and implores her to testify against Vince. Knowing her life will be in danger, she reluctantly agrees. To protect her, Lt. Souther arranges for Deloris to hide out in the last place Vince would look for her - a convent. She is to stay there until the trial, which is at least two months off.

Deloris goes into hiding at St. Catherine's, a Roman Catholic convent in a seedy, crime-ridden neighborhood of [[San Francisco]]. The convent is attached to a church that is in disrepair and poorly attended. Only the Reverend Mother knows her real identity, and her reason for being there. She is required to wear a nun's habit, and is given the name "Sister Mary Clarence". Her lounge singer attitudes quickly alienate the Reverend Mother ([[Maggie Smith]]), who is only pacified by the promise of funds for the impoverished convent. Deloris chafes at the spartan lifestyle of a nun. When she complains, the Reverend Mother points out the flaws in Deloris' life, insisting that God brought her to the convent for a reason. After this lecture, Deloris begins to make friends with the other sisters, particularly Sister Mary Patrick ([[Kathy Najimy]]), an eternally sunny individual, Sister Mary Lazarus ([[Mary Wickes]]), a decidedly old-fashioned nun, and young Sister Mary Robert ([[Wendy Makkena]]), a [[postulant]] who seeks meaning in her life.

When Deloris hears the convent's choir, which is horribly lackluster and off-key, at Sunday Mass, she breaks. She calls Lt. Souther and begs him to find another safe-house for her. He informs her that someone in the police department is leaking information about witnesses, so moving her would be risky, and she must stay where she is. That night, Deloris sneaks out of the convent to visit the biker bar across the street, and Sisters Mary Patrick and Mary Robert follow her. When they return, an angry Reverend Mother is prepared to have Deloris kicked out, but she begs for forgiveness. Reverend Mother relents, on the condition that Deloris joins the choir.

Deloris goes to choir practice, and finds that the group is terrible. Having heard that Deloris has a background in music, Sister Mary Patrick suggests that she should teach them. Urged on by the choir members, Mary Lazarus, the choir mistress, grudgingly agrees. Deloris reminds the sisters that they must feel what they sing, as it is a form of rejoicing. She also discovers that Sister Mary Robert has a powerful voice, hidden by shyness. Under Deloris' tutelage, the choir is transformed. At the next Sunday Mass, they begin with a beautiful rendition of "Hail, Holy Queen", and the Reverend Mother is visibly pleased. Then, suddenly, the song becomes soulful and syncopated - a fusion of [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[rock and Roll Music]]. People in the street outside are intrigued, and find their way into the nearly-empty church.

Reverend Mother is furious at Deloris' attempts to restyle the music. But the priest of the church, Monsignor O'Hara ([[Joseph Maher]]), loves the new arrangements, and praises the [[Abbess]] for her innovation. Deloris craftily mentions that Reverend Mother wants the nuns to perform community service in the neighborhood, something she has opposed for safety reasons. The sisters eagerly take to the streets, where they clean and paint, run a soup kitchen, and create a playground for inner-city children. All the while, Deloris teaches them new songs, including [[Mary Wells]]' "[[My Guy]]" as "My God". Church attendance and financial support skyrocket. The nuns even find themselves on the local news, which is not a good thing for Deloris, who is supposed to be invisible. Capping off their success, Monsignor O'Hara announces that [[Pope John Paul II]] plans to stop by the church for a special concert, during the upcoming Papal visit to San Francisco.

Unfortunately for Deloris, the "leak" in the police department, Detective Tate, notices that Lt. Souther has made donations to the church. Realizing that Deloris must be hiding there, he calls Vince with the news. Lt. Souther discovers his betrayal and has him arrested. Since the cat is out of the bag, he immediately flies to San Francisco to tell Deloris what has happened and, hopefully, to protect her. He finds her unharmed, though fails to bring her in his custody; chance for Vince's suddenly emerging goons to kidnap Deloris and Sister Mary Robert. After Deloris helps the young nun to escape, Mary Robert returns to the convent and tells them of Vince's plan to take Deloris back to Reno. the Reverend Mother reveals that Deloris was not really a nun but a witness in protective custody. Despite their not always getting along, Deloris's friends convince Reverend Mother to help her, and they guilt-trip a helicopter pilot into flying them to Reno.

Deloris, still in her habit but tied up, remains calm and prays for guidance while the nuns dash about the casino, searching for her. Vince's underlings cannot bring themselves to kill Deloris while she wears a habit, and she manages to escape when they untie her to remove the garb. She meets up with the sisters, but as they all head for the exit, Vince and his henchmen find and corner them. Vince orders his men to shoot Deloris, but they still can't bring themselves to kill a nun. Vince angrily sneers that Deloris is "just a broad", and far from being a nun. Reverend Mother passionately defends her, claiming that she has all the qualities of a true nun. The delay proves just long enough for Lt. Souther to shoot Vince through a window before Vince can shoot Deloris. The police arrest the wounded Vince and his associates. As they are led away, Deloris' last "two words" to Vince are, unexpectedly, "bless you". 

The Reverend Mother is emotionally moved at this revelation of character shown by Delores as they both turn to regail their adventure.

Before Deloris returns to her singing career, she leads the nuns in a rendition of "[[I Will Follow Him]]" for the Pope. Sister Mary Robert finally realizes her true potential and sings a solo during the song, and the Pope himself happily claps to the beat. The film ends with the Pope and church patrons giving the choir a standing ovation. The final shot of Deloris at the altar turns into a magazine cover telling her story, headlined "Heaven Helped Me", leading off a montage of covers, and it's revealed that Deloris starts a recording career with "Listen, Sister!", a [[rock and roll]] record, and "Gonna Make You Pray", a [[gospel]] album.

==Production==
Screenwriter [[Paul Rudnick]] pitched "Sister Act" to producer [[Scott Rudin]] in 1987, and it was agreed that [[Bette Midler]] would be best for the lead role.

'''''Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit''''' is a [[1993 in film|1993]] [[comedy film]] starring [[Whoopi Goldberg]]. Directed by [[Bill Duke]], and released by [[Touchstone Pictures]], it is the [[sequel]] to the successful 1992 film ''[[Sister Act]]''. Most of the original cast reprise their roles in the sequel, including [[Maggie Smith]], [[Kathy Najimy]], [[Wendy Makkena]], and [[Mary Wickes]]. 

==Plot==
Sister Mary Patrick ([[Kathy Najimy]]), Sr. Mary Robert ([[Wendy Makkena]]) and Sr. Mary Lazarus ([[Mary Wickes]]) visit Deloris ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]), now starring in a final performance Las Vegas musical about her misadventures in the convent. After the show, the three sisters ask her for help. The sisters are now in the service of St. Francis Academy, a high school Deloris had attended herself, that is run by the diocese and is in danger of closing down. Despite the best efforts of the sisters and staff, the school's administrator, Mr. Crisp ([[James Coburn]]) is working to convince the diocese to close the school, thinking it has better use as a parking lot.  The kids aren't much better, disrespectful and argumentative, and they get so bad, that, according to dialogue, Sister Mary Patrick is driven to frown, twice.  

Deloris initially declines their request, but changes her mind when she hears that Mother Superior ([[Maggie Smith]]) is in a desperate situation. Upon their arrival at St. Francis Academy, Mother Superior asks her to teach music to a class of teenagers who are actually rebellious. At first, the students play tricks on her, hoping to drive her away.  Eventually, they realize that, not only is she more powerful and determined than they are, but she also has something to offer them.  Slowly, the entire class, except Rita Watson, eventually grow to like her. During the course of the school year, Deloris{{ndash}}as Sister Mary Clarence{{ndash}}discovers their singing talent and decides to organize them into a choir.  Nobody but the sisters believes that they can actually pull this off, partly because of the students' lackluster attitude, until one of the students, an overly-talkative expert on African history with a remarkably mousy voice, hits a beautiful high note during "Oh, happy day" that surprises even Deloris.

Deloris obtains use of the school's old music room. As the other sisters help clean it up, they discover old trophies and ribbons the school won from the All-State Music Competition from decades before. They find out the competition still takes place in Hollywood, and they convince Deloris and the students to enter, in the hopes they can save St. Francis from closing if they win. Upon raising the funds for the trip, the choir prepares.  

Meanwhile, Rita Watson ([[Lauryn Hill]]), one of the rebellious students, is discovering her talent as a singer, much to the dismay of her single parent mother ([[Sheryl Lee Ralph]]). Mrs. Watson tries to convince her daughter that there is no future in singing. Rita refuses to go along with Delores' changes to the class, and leaves it for several days.  However, she returns, insistant on her dreams of making as a singer, despite her mother's total opposition.  Faking her mother's consent, Rita goes with the choir to the competition. Finding a note, her mother realizes what Rita has done, and desperately drives to Hollywood to bring her home.  When she gets there, though, Mrs. Watson listens to her daughter sing and discovers that she was wrong; Rita ''does'' have the talent necessary to make it as a musician and be successful, and she is proud of her daughter's performance.  

As the group heads to the competition, the school board discovers that Deloris is actually a Las Vegas showgirl. The board heads after them to withdraw the choir from the competition. The school's principal, Father Maurice ([[Barnard Hughes]]), is greeted by the students who think that he came to support them. Touched by their appreciation and glowing faces, he decides not to withdraw the choir, against the wishes of Mr. Crisp. After Father Ignatius ([[Michael Jeter]]), Father Wolfgang ([[Thomas Gottschalk]]) and Father Thomas ([[Brad Sullivan]]) trap Crisp in a storage closet, held closed by the cook's famous frozen sausage, they all then race to watch the choir perform.  The choir then sings "Joyful, Joyful" in the competition and defeats the previous year champions, thereby saving St. Francis from closure. Mr. Crisp is transferred, with the aide of the Mother Superior, to another place in the archdiocese. Afterward, the choir learns of Deloris's true identity, to which she tells them all, ''"I am not now, nor have I ever been a Las Vegas showgirl...I am a '''headliner!'''"''.  

During the credits, the majority of the cast sings "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" together.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Although not as successful as ''[[Sister Act]]'', it still grossed [[United States dollar|$]]60 million in the [[United States]] and nearly $100 million worldwide. The movie also attracted a much younger audience towards [[Gospel music]], as well as helping to boost [[Lauryn Hill]]'s music career.

'''''Quantum of Solace''''' ([[2008 in film|2008]]) is the 22nd [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond film]], produced by [[:en:EON Productions]] and is the direct [[sequel]] to the 2006 film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. Directed by [[Marc Forster]], it features [[Daniel Craig]]'s second performance as [[:en:James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. In the film, Bond battles wealthy businessman [[Dominic Greene]] ([[Mathieu Amalric]]), a member of the [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] organization<!-- Organisation is the British spelling of organization, and the article uses British spelling --> posing as an [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] who intends to stage a [[coup d'état]] in [[Bolivia]] to seize control of the nation's water supply. (In fact, the story is remarkably similar to a [[2000 Cochabamba protests|real-life event]] in which [[Bechtel#Bolivia|Bechtel]] was the major player.) Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, [[Vesper Lynd]] ([[Eva Green]]), and is assisted by [[Camille Montes]] ([[Olga Kurylenko]]), who is also seeking revenge.

Producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] developed the film's plot while ''Casino Royale'' was being shot. [[Neal Purvis]], [[Robert Wade (screenwriter)|Robert Wade]], [[Paul Haggis]], and [[Joshua Zetumer]] contributed to the script. The title was chosen from a 1960 short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', though the film does not contain any elements of the original story. Location filming took place in [[Mexico]], [[Panama]], [[Chile]], [[Italy]], [[Austria]], and [[Wales]] while interior sets were built and filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]]. Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage [[Douglas DC-3]] was used for a dogfight sequence, and [[Dennis Gassner]]'s set designs are reminiscent of [[Ken Adam]]'s work on several early Bond films. Taking a course away from the usual [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villains]], Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasize the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.

The film premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 29 October 2008, gathering mixed reviews which mainly praised Craig's gritty performance and the film's action sequences while feeling that ''Quantum of Solace'' was not as impressive as the predecessor ''Casino Royale''. It is also the second highest grossing James Bond film, without adjusting for inflation, making $586,090,727 worldwide, while becoming one of the highest grossing Bond films in the United States.

==Plot==
<!-- Please remember to keep it short and around 600 words per WikiProject Films/Style guidelines, and that a spoiler warning is unnecessary per Wikipedia:Spoiler.-->
James Bond ([[Daniel Craig]]) is driving from [[Lake Como]] to [[Siena]], [[Italy]] with the captured [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] ([[Jesper Christensen]]). After evading pursuers, Bond and [[M (James Bond)|M]] ([[Judi Dench]]) interrogate White regarding his organization, [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]]. M's bodyguard, Mitchell, a [[double agent]], attacks M, enabling White to escape; Bond chases Mitchell across Siena and kills him. 

Bond and M travel search Mitchell's flat and discover he had a contact in [[Haiti]]. Bond heads to Haiti to investigate Mitchell's contact, Edmund Slate, and learns that Slate was sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] ([[Olga Kurylenko]]) at the behest of her lover, [[Dominic Greene]] ([[Mathieu Amalric]]), the chairman of an ecological organization called Greene Planet. While observing her meeting with Greene, Bond learns that Greene is helping the [[Bolivia]]n general Medrano ([[Joaquin Cosio]])&mdash;who murdered Camille's family&mdash;overthrow his government in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.

After rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Austria]]; en route, CIA agent Gregg Beam ([[David Harbour]]) strikes a non-interference deal with Greene to maintain access to Bolivian oil, overruling the objections of Felix Leiter ([[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]). Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, and a gunfight ensues in the adjoining restaurant. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard of Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is killed, and M, assuming Bond is the killer, has his passports and credit cards revoked. Bond convinces his old ally [[René Mathis]] ([[Giancarlo Giannini]]) to accompany him to [[La Paz]]. They are greeted by [[Strawberry Fields (character)|Strawberry Fields]] ([[Gemma Arterton]]), an MI6 field operative from the [[Diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom|British Consulate]], who demands that Bond return to the UK on the next available flight; nonetheless, Bond soon seduces her before they attend a party Greene holds that night.

At the party, Bond rescues Camille again from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police working for Medrano; they had earlier attacked Mathis and put him in the trunk of Bond's car to frame him, and in the ensuing struggle Mathis is killed. Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition in a [[Douglas DC-3]] plane, but are shot down by an [[Alenia Aermacchi|Aermacchi]] [[Aermacchi SF.260|SF.260]] fighter and a [[Bell Helicopter|Bell]] [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopter.  They parachute out of the burning plane into a [[sinkhole]]. In the cave, Bond and Camille discover Quantum is not after oil but is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water, normally flowing in [[subterranean river]]s, to create a monopoly. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns that Quantum murdered Fields by drowning her naked in [[crude oil]]. M orders Bond arrested for disobeying orders but he defies her and escapes. 

Bond meets Leiter, who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet at an [[eco-hotel]] in the [[Atacama Desert|Bolivian desert]] to finalize the coup; warned by Leiter, he evades American special forces attempting to kill him. At the hotel, Greene and Medrano negotiate their terms. Greene then finally reveals his true plans. By gaining control of the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Greene badgers Medrano into accepting a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water utility company at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the hotel and executes the chief of police for betraying Mathis, and then confronts Greene. The hotel is destroyed during the battle, but Camille kills Medrano, and Bond captures Greene. After interrogating him about Quantum, Bond leaves Greene stranded in the middle of the desert with only a can of [[motor oil]]. Bond and Camille kiss before they part.

Bond goes to [[Kazan]], [[Russia]], where he confronts [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira (Simon Kassianides), who is with Corrine ([[Stana Katic]]), a Canadian agent. Yusef is a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections, such as Vesper. In an act of restraint, Bond decides not to kill Yusef and allows MI6 to arrest him. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found in the middle of the desert dead, with motor oil in his stomach, but Bond denies knowing anything. M also reveals that Felix has been promoted and has taken Beam's place. She reinstates Bond as an agent; he tells M that he never left. As he leaves, he drops the necklace Yusef had given Vesper in the snow.

{{main|List of Quantum of Solace characters}}
*[[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]].

*[[Mathieu Amalric]] as [[Dominic Greene]], Main villain. A leading member of Quantum posing as a businessman working in [[reforestation]] and charity funding for [[environmental science]]. Amalric acknowledged taking the role was an easy decision because, "It's impossible to say to your kids that 'I could have been in a Bond film but I refused.'"<ref name=guardian/> Amalric wanted to wear make-up for the role, but Forster explained that he wanted Greene not to look grotesque, but to symbolise the hidden evils in society.<ref name=ew/> Amalric modelled his performance on "the smile of [[Tony Blair]] [and] the craziness of [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]]," the latter of whom he called "the worst villain we [the French] have ever had [...] he walks around thinking he's in a Bond film."<ref>{{cite news | title = Mathieu Amalric to model Bond Villain on Tony Blair | work = [[thelondonpaper]] | date = 2008-01-24 | url = http://www.thelondonpaper.com/cs/Satellite/london/news/article/1157150397402?packedargs=aid%3D1157150397402%26suffix%3DArticleController | accessdate=2008-01-31}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He later claimed this was not criticism of either politician, but rather an example of how a politician relies on performance instead of a genuine policy to win power. "Sarkozy, is just a better actor than [his presidential opponent] [[Ségolène Royal]] &ndash; that's all," he explained.<ref name=environment/> Amalric and Forster reconceived the character, who was supposed to have a "special skill" in the script, to someone who uses pure animal instinct when fighting Bond in the climax.<ref name=pity>{{cite news|title=Quantum of Solace: Mathieu Amalric on playing James Bond's nemesis|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2008-10-02|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/10/23/sm_mathieuamalric.xml|accessdate=2008-10-23 | location=London | first=Murphy | last=Williams}}</ref> [[Bruno Ganz]] was also considered for the part,<ref name=diary22>{{cite news |title=Bond 22 Pre-Production Diary (22)|work=[[MI6.co.uk]] |date=2007-12-30 |url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/bond_22_preprod_diary22.php3?t=&s=articles |accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> but Forster decided Amalric gave a pitiful quality.<ref name=pity/>
*[[Gemma Arterton]] as MI6 Agent [[Agent Strawberry Fields (character)#Strawberry Fields|Strawberry Fields]], who works at the British [[consulate]] in [[Bolivia]]. Fields, who is merely an office worker as described by M, takes herself seriously and tries to over-power Bond when the pair meet. She later was seduced by Bond and infiltrates Greene's fund raiser party with him and ended up paying the ultimate price. Forster found Arterton a witty actress and selected her from a reported 1,500 candidates. One of the casting directors asked her to audition for the role, having seen her portray Rosaline in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' at the [[Globe Theatre]].<ref name=dianarigg>{{cite news | author = Chris Tilly | title = Gemma Arteron Q&A | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2008-01-30 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/848/848237p1.html | accessdate=2008-01-30}}</ref> Arterton said Fields was "not so frolicsome" as other Bond girls, but is instead "fresh and young, not [...] a [[femme fatale]]."<ref name=bbctitle/> Arterton described Fields as a homage to the 1960s Bond girls, comparing her red wig to [[Diana Rigg]], who played [[Tracy Bond]] in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''. Rigg, alongside [[Honor Blackman]], is one of her favourite Bond girls.<ref name=dianarigg/> Arterton had to film her character's death scene first day on the set.

*[[Giancarlo Giannini]] as René Mathis, Bond's ally who was mistakenly believed to be a traitor in ''Casino Royale''. Having been acquitted, he chooses to aid Bond again and watches as Bond is under the strict authority of Fields.
*[[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] as [[Felix Leiter]], Bond's ally at the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. This marked the first time the same actor played Leiter twice in a row. Only [[David Hedison]] had previously played the character twice, in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973) and ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' (1989), but these performances were not consecutive.<ref name=guardian/> Early script drafts gave Leiter a larger role, but his screentime was restricted by on-set rewrites.<ref name=secret>{{cite news | title = The Secrets of Quantum of Solace | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2008-04-05 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/864/864542p1.html | accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref>
*[[Judi Dench]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]]. Forster felt Dench was underused in the previous films and wanted to make her part bigger, having her interact with Bond more because she is "the only woman Bond doesn’t see in a sexual context," which Forster finds interesting.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fostering change|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=2008-10-11|url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2008/10/11/movies/2202154&sec=movies|accessdate=2008-10-13}}</ref>

*[[David Harbour]] as Gregg Beam, the CIA Section Chief for South America and a contact of Felix Leiter.

*Glenn Foster as Craig Mitchell, M's bodyguard and a double agent.
*[[Oona Castilla Chaplin]] as '[[damsel in distress]]' - girl saved by Kurylenko in one of last sequences.

Directors [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Alfonso Cuarón]] are friends of Marc Forster and while filming he asked them to cameo, providing voices in the Spanish language. Cuarón appears as a Bolivian helicopter pilot, while del Toro provides several other voices.<ref>{{cite news|title=Del Toro, Cuaron do voices in new Bond film|agency=Associated Press|date=2008-10-23|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hU3ob2X-IVqYjDCrXtxIbZUi8ZkAD9405TFO0|accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref>

Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up."<ref name=guardian/> He said that "Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [Vesper Lynd] has been killed,"<ref name=confuse>{{cite news |title=Daniel: the title is meant to confuse |work=[[Press and Journal (Scotland)|Press and Journal]] |date=2008-01-24}}</ref> and therefore, "[Bond is] looking for revenge [...] to make himself happy with the world again."<ref name=bbctitle/> Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in ''Casino Royale''.<ref name=quantum/> Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd.<ref name=criminal/> Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to "let me know what it feels like" when he succeeds, the implication of the title being that it will be a small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.

During filming, after the strike ended, Forster read a [[spec script]] by [[Joshua Zetumer]], which he liked, and hired him to reshape scenes for the later parts of the shoot, which the director was still unsatisfied with.<ref name=zetumer>{{cite news | title = A James Bond Set Visit and Seven Exclusive Quantum of Solace Images!  | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date = 2008-04-04 | url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/quantum_of_solace/news/1719930/a_james_bond_set_visit_and_seven_exclusive_quantum_of_solace_images | accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref> Forster had the actors rehearse their scenes, as he liked to film scenes continually.<ref name=environment>{{cite news | author = Karl Rozemeyer | title = Mathieu Amalric on Being the 'Bond 22' Villain | work = [[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] | date = 2008-03-18 | url = http://www.premiere.com/features/4455/mathieu-amalric-on-being-the-bond-22-villain.html | accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> Zetumer rewrote dialogue depending on the actors' ideas each day.<ref name=environment/>

Louise Frogley replaced [[Lindy Hemming]] as [[costume design]]er, though Hemming remained as supervisor.

The film returns to the traditional [[James Bond gun barrel sequence|gun barrel opening shot]], which was altered into part of the story for ''Casino Royale'' where it was moved to the end of the title sequence. In this film the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end of the movie, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise,<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Caro|title=James Bond: 15 facts to know now|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=2008-11-09|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/arts/chi-bond-1109-covernov09,0,4869399.story|accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref> and to signify the conclusion of the story begun in the previous film. The opening credits sequence was created by [[MK12]]; Having worked on Forster's ''[[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|Stranger than Fiction]]'' and ''[[The Kite Runner (film)|The Kite Runner]]'', MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on in production, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the [[#Music|title singer]] was changed. MK12 selected various [[twilight]] colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on a dot motif based on the gunbarrel shot.

''Quantum of Solace'' was the last in [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor]]'s three-film deal that began with 2002's ''[[Die Another Day]]''. Although Ford sold over 90% of the [[Aston Martin]] company in 2007, the [[Aston Martin DBS V12]] returned for the film's car chase around Lake Garda;<ref>{{cite news |title=Aston Martin DBS to star in new James Bond film |work=[[Aston Martin]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.astonmartin.com/thecompany/news?a=14d34f22-1324-4ca5-acbb-764f80c7d7f2 |accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref> [[Dan Bradley]] was hired as [[second unit]] director because of his work on the second and third [[Bourne (film series)|''Bourne'' films]], so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in ''Casino Royale''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Borys Kit |title=Bradley tapped to aid Bond stunts |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2007-09-04 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i61cdc71247ef46a7ec4bddbba9463397 |accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> He had intended to use [[Ford GT]]s for the opening chase,<ref>{{cite web |title=Dan Bradley interview |work=Bourne Stunt Simulator |url=http://www.bournestuntsimulator.com/danbradley/ |accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref> but it was replaced by the [[Alfa Romeo 159]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1902288/James-Bond-filming-suspended-after-third-accident-leaves-stuntman-in-coma.html|title=James Bond filming suspended after third accident leaves stuntman in coma|accessdate=2008-04-28|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2008-04-28 | location=London | first=Malcolm | last=Moore}}</ref> After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, the cars and the truck were shot at Pinewood against a bluescreen.<ref name=vfxworld>{{cite news|author=Bill Desowitz|title=A Quantum of VFX for James Bond|work=VFX World|date=2008-12-03|url=http://vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3844&page=1#|accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref> Originally three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence: but Forster felt the scene was running too long and re-edited the scene so it only looked like two Romeos were chasing Bond.<ref name=fxguide/> Six Aston Martins were destroyed during filming, and one of them was purchased by a fan.<ref name=criminal/>

Fourteen cameras were used to film the [[Palio di Siena]], footage which was later edited into the main sequence. Aerial shots using helicopters were banned, and the crew were also forbidden from showing any violence "involving either people or animals."<ref name=paliodisiena/> To shoot the foot chase in [[Siena]] in April 2008 four camera cranes were built in the town, and a [[Skycam|cable camera]] was also used.<ref name=siena/> [[Framestore]] worked on the Siena chase, duplicating the 1000 extras during principal photography to match shots of the 40,000 strong audience at the real Palio, removing wires that held Craig and the stuntmen in the rooftop segment of the chase, and digital expansion of the floor and skylight in the art gallery Bond and Mitchell fall into.<ref name=vfxworld/> The art gallery fight was intended to be simple, but during filming Craig's stunt double accidentally fell from the construction scaffolding. Forster preferred the idea of Bond hanging from ropes reaching for his gun to kill Mitchell, rather than having both men run out of the building to continue their chase as specified in the script, and the number of effects shots increased.<ref name=vfxworld/>

To film the aerial dogfight, a "Snakehead" camera was built and placed on the nose and tail of a [[Piper Aerostar]] 700. [[SolidWorks]], who provided the software used to design the camera, stated "pilots for the first time can fly as aggressively as they dare without sacrificing the drama of the shot." The camera could turn 360 degrees and was shaped like a [[periscope]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Chris Reidy | title = "Snakehead" films James Bond dogfight footage | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | date = 2008-05-12 | url =  http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2008/05/_the_concord_of.html | accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> The crew also mounted SpaceCams on helicopters, and placed cameras with 1600&nbsp;mm lenses underground, to cover the action.<ref name=dogfight/> Forster wanted to film the planefight as a homage to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[North by Northwest]]'', and chose planes like the [[Douglas DC-3]] to suit that.<ref name=aicnqa>{{cite news|title=Capone talks with James Bond himself, Daniel Craig, and Quantum of Solace director Marc Forster in London!!!|work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=2008-09-21|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38427|accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = For Your Eyes Only: RT in Austria with James Bond | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date = 2008-05-09 | url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/quantum_of_solace/news/1727255/2/for_your_eyes_only_rt_in_austria_with_james_bond | accessdate=2008-05-16}}</ref> 

The [[free-fall]] scene involved its own set of challenges, Craig disliked the idea of "being hung by wires and blown by a large fan in front of a green screen" but actual [[sky diving]] coverage has serious drawbacks. It’s not only difficult, dangerous and time-consuming, but nearly always results in problematic head-replacements for close-ups. Stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell and VFX Designer Kevin Tod Haug, presented the idea of filming the scene in a large [[vertical wind tunnel]] in [[Bedford]] in order to do this sequence as practically as possible.  
While a great solution for the actors’ performances the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert, and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight [[Dalsa Origin]] cameras (supported by 7 HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was used to create a [[virtual camera]] with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]<ref name=fxguide/> developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.   
During the shooting in the wind tunnel Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact lenses that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, they only shot for thirty seconds at a time.<ref name=ugoqa>{{cite news|url=http://movieblog.ugo.com/index.php/movieblog/more/your_quantum_of_solace_questions_answered/|title=Your Quantum of Solace Questions Answered!|work=[[UGO Networks]]|date=2008-09-21|accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref> Forster wished he had more time to work on the free-fall scene.<ref name=vfxworld/>

The [[Moving Picture Company]] created the climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were supervised by [[Chris Corbould]], and post-production MPC had to enhance the sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look more dangerous.<ref name=vfxworld/> A full-scale replica of the building's exterior was used for the exploding part Bond and Camille escape from. 
The boat chase was another scene that required very little CGI.

[[David Arnold]], who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, returned for ''Quantum of Solace''. He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on ''Casino Royale'', the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to "really work it out."

Though there was no [[novelization|novelisation]] despite its original storyline, [[Penguin Books]] published a compilation of Fleming's short stories entitled ''[[Quantum of Solace (short story collection)|Quantum of Solace: The Complete James Bond Short Stories]]'', with a UK release date of 29 May 2008<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0141189622 Amazon.co.uk listing].

The November/December 2008 issue of [[Cigar Aficionado]] was a special James Bond edition written by [[David Giammarco]], noted author of [[For Your Eyes Only: Behind the Scenes of the James Bond Films]], and featured an extensive 20-page feature on the making of ''Quantum of Solace'' from his exclusive interviews on location with Daniel Craig, Gemma Arterton, Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, director Marc Forster, and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. This tribute issue of the upscale magazine also featured Giammarco's in-depth profile of 007 author Ian Fleming and the 46-year history of the James Bond films. The ''[[Cigar Aficionado]]'' James Bond special edition became the magazine's biggest-selling issue around the world.

However, only 36% of selected notable reviewers gave it a positive write-up, with an average rating of 5.6/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Quantum of Solace''|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/quantum_of_solace/|accessdate=2008-10-25}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] calculated a score of 58 out of 100 from 38 reviews, indicating a "mixed or average" response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/quantumofsolace|title=Quantum of Solace|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref> Critics generally preferred ''Casino Royale'', but continued to praise Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series. The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the serious and gritty feel that the film carried over.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tom Butler|title=UK Tomatometer Preview: Quantum Of Solace - Is the New Bond Shaken or Stirred?|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=2008-10-31|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/quantum_of_solace/news/1777726/uk_tomatometer_preview_quantum_of_solace_is_the_new_bond_shaken_or_stirred|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref> 

[[Roger Moore]], the third actor to play Bond in the films, continued to feel Craig was a "damn good Bond but the film as a whole, there was a bit too much flash cutting [and] it was just like a commercial of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on."<ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Roger Moore weighs in on `Quantum of Solace`|work=[[MI6.co.uk]]|date=2009-03-16|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=7432&t=mi6&s=news|accessdate=2009-03-17}}</ref> 

[[Kim Newman]] of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' gave it 4/5, remarking it was not "bigger and better than ''Casino Royale'', [which is] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond’s mission has barely begun." However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Kim Newman]]|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134523|title=''Quantum of Solace'' (12A)|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire Online]]|accessdate=2008-10-22}}</ref> ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' review noted that "[f]ollowing ''Casino Royale'' was never going to be easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand’s successful relaunch crashing back to earth — with a yawn"; the screenplay "is at times incomprehensible" and the casting "is a mess." The review concludes that "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get [[product placement]]; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Cosmo Landesman]]|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article5001623.ece|title=Quantum of Solace - The Sunday Times review|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=2008-10-26|accessdate=2008-10-28 | location=London}}</ref> 

''The Guardian'' gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars,<!--more than the Sunday Times that is--> and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he 
"made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" and calling the film "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes "''Quantum of Solace'' isn't as good as ''Casino Royale'': the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Peter Bradshaw]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/18/jamesbond1|title=Quantum of Solace|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2008-10-18|accessdate=2008-10-28 | location=London}}</ref>

''[[:en:Screen International|Screen Daily]]'' says "Notices will focus - rightly - on Craig's magnetism as the steely, sexy, murderous MI6 agent, but two other factors weigh in and freshen up proceedings: Forster's new technical team, led by cinematographer Roberto Schaefer and production designer Dennis Gassner. And the ongoing shift of M, as played by Judi Dench, to front and centre: the Bond girls fade into insignificance as she becomes his moral counterpoint and theirs is the only real relationship on screen." The review continues, "Bond is, as has been previously noted, practically the [[Martin Scorsese]] of the [[BAFTA]]s: 22 films later, with grosses probably close to the [[GDP]] of one of the small nations it depicts, it's still waiting for that [[Alexander Korda]] award. The best ''Casino Royale'' could achieve was a gong for sound. Will this be the year that changes its fortunes?"<ref>{{cite web|title=Fionnuala Halligan|title=Quantum of Solace|work=Screen Daily|date=2008-10-20|url=http://www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=41477|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'', who praised the previous film, disliked ''Quantum of Solace''. He wrote that the plot was mediocre, characters weak and that Bond lacked his usual personality, despite his praise for Craig's interpretation of the role. Throughout his review, he emphasised that "James Bond is not an action hero," and also criticised the lack of a fantastical villainous lair and the Bond girls' names not being [[double entendres]].<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081111/REVIEWS/811129989 Review] by Roger Ebert, November 12, 2008</ref>
Some writers criticised the choice of ''Quantum of Solace'' as a title. "Yes, it's a bad title," wrote Marni Weisz, the editor of ''Famous'', a [[Canada|Canadian]] film publication distributed in movie theatres in that country, in an editorial entitled "At least it's not ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]''."<ref>Marni Weisz, "At least it's not Octopussy," ''Famous'', October 2008, p. 6</ref>

Like ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', no book adaptation of the movie was released despite having no relations with the short story except for its title. Instead, [[Penguin Books]] released ''[[Quantum of Solace (short story collection)|Quantum of Solace: The Complete James Bond Short Stories]]'' which is a compilation of both ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]'' and ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', both written by [[Ian Fleming]].
