'''''Sister Act''''' is a 1992 [[United States|American]] [[comedy film]] released by [[Touchstone Pictures]]. Directed by [[Emile Ardolino]], it features musical arrangements by [[Marc Shaiman]] and stars [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as a [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] lounge singer who has been put under [[protective custody]] in a [[San Francisco]] [[convent]] and has to pretend to be a [[nun]] when a mob boss puts her on his hit list. Also in the cast are [[Maggie Smith]], [[Kathy Najimy]], [[Wendy Makkena]], [[Mary Wickes]], and [[Harvey Keitel]]. The film is #83 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''The 100 Funniest Movies'' list.

The film was followed by a 1993 sequel, ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]''. It also inspired [[Sister Act (musical)|a musical stage version]] that premiered at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in [[Pasadena, California]] in 2006, and opened at the [[London Palladium]] with previews from May 7, 2009.

==Plot==
The movie opens at a Catholic elementary school in 1968. There, a strict nun scolds a little girl named Deloris for giving sarcastic answers in class. The nun warns the girl that she will be doomed to a life of sin if she does not mend her ways.

In the present day, Deloris van Cartier ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]) is a lounge singer at a casino in [[Reno, Nevada]]. She is involved in a relationship with a married man, mobster Vincent "Vince" LaRocca ([[Harvey Keitel]]). Deloris is oblivious to his criminal activities, as he always keeps her out of his "business". After a fight, Vince tries to win Deloris' affection back with a beautiful purple mink coat, but she discovers that the coat belongs to Vince's wife. Furious, she decides to break up with Vince that night. She heads for Vince's office in the casino where she works, to return the coat and tell Vince she's leaving him. Meanwhile, Vince is in the office confronting his limo driver, whom he accuses of being a police informant. When Deloris walks in, she hears a shot and sees the limo driver dead on the floor. Vince's thugs, Willy ([[Richard Portnow]]) and Joey (Robert Miranda), are also present. They chase Deloris, but she escapes through the basement of the casino and disappears into the street, whereupon she takes a cab to the police station. Lieutenant Eddie Souther ([[Bill Nunn]]) hears her story and implores her to testify against Vince. Knowing her life will be in danger, she reluctantly agrees. To protect her, Lt. Souther arranges for Deloris to hide out in the last place Vince would look for her - a convent. She is to stay there until the trial, which is at least two months off.

Deloris goes into hiding at St. Catherine's, a Roman Catholic convent in a seedy, crime-ridden neighborhood of [[San Francisco]]. The convent is attached to a church that is in disrepair and poorly attended. Only the Reverend Mother knows her real identity, and her reason for being there. She is required to wear a nun's habit, and is given the name "Sister Mary Clarence". Her lounge singer attitudes quickly alienate the Reverend Mother ([[Maggie Smith]]), who is only pacified by the promise of funds for the impoverished convent. Deloris chafes at the spartan lifestyle of a nun. When she complains, the Reverend Mother points out the flaws in Deloris' life, insisting that God brought her to the convent for a reason. After this lecture, Deloris begins to make friends with the other sisters, particularly Sister Mary Patrick ([[Kathy Najimy]]), an eternally sunny individual, Sister Mary Lazarus ([[Mary Wickes]]), a decidedly old-fashioned nun, and young Sister Mary Robert ([[Wendy Makkena]]), a [[postulant]] who seeks meaning in her life.

When Deloris hears the convent's choir, which is horribly lackluster and off-key, at Sunday Mass, she breaks. She calls Lt. Souther and begs him to find another safe-house for her. He informs her that someone in the police department is leaking information about witnesses, so moving her would be risky, and she must stay where she is. That night, Deloris sneaks out of the convent to visit the biker bar across the street, and Sisters Mary Patrick and Mary Robert follow her. When they return, an angry Reverend Mother is prepared to have Deloris kicked out, but she begs for forgiveness. Reverend Mother relents, on the condition that Deloris joins the choir.

Deloris goes to choir practice, and finds that the group is terrible. Having heard that Deloris has a background in music, Sister Mary Patrick suggests that she should teach them. Urged on by the choir members, Mary Lazarus, the choir mistress, grudgingly agrees. Deloris reminds the sisters that they must feel what they sing, as it is a form of rejoicing. She also discovers that Sister Mary Robert has a powerful voice, hidden by shyness. Under Deloris' tutelage, the choir is transformed. At the next Sunday Mass, they begin with a beautiful rendition of "Hail, Holy Queen", and the Reverend Mother is visibly pleased. Then, suddenly, the song becomes soulful and syncopated - a fusion of [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[rock and Roll Music]]. People in the street outside are intrigued, and find their way into the nearly-empty church.

Reverend Mother is furious at Deloris' attempts to restyle the music. But the priest of the church, Monsignor O'Hara ([[Joseph Maher]]), loves the new arrangements, and praises the [[Abbess]] for her innovation. Deloris craftily mentions that Reverend Mother wants the nuns to perform community service in the neighborhood, something she has opposed for safety reasons. The sisters eagerly take to the streets, where they clean and paint, run a soup kitchen, and create a playground for inner-city children. All the while, Deloris teaches them new songs, including [[Mary Wells]]' "[[My Guy]]" as "My God". Church attendance and financial support skyrocket. The nuns even find themselves on the local news, which is not a good thing for Deloris, who is supposed to be invisible. Capping off their success, Monsignor O'Hara announces that [[Pope John Paul II]] plans to stop by the church for a special concert, during the upcoming Papal visit to San Francisco.

Unfortunately for Deloris, the "leak" in the police department, Detective Tate, notices that Lt. Souther has made donations to the church. Realizing that Deloris must be hiding there, he calls Vince with the news. Lt. Souther discovers his betrayal and has him arrested. Since the cat is out of the bag, he immediately flies to San Francisco to tell Deloris what has happened and, hopefully, to protect her. He finds her unharmed, though fails to bring her in his custody; chance for Vince's suddenly emerging goons to kidnap Deloris and Sister Mary Robert. After Deloris helps the young nun to escape, Mary Robert returns to the convent and tells them of Vince's plan to take Deloris back to Reno. the Reverend Mother reveals that Deloris was not really a nun but a witness in protective custody. Despite their not always getting along, Deloris's friends convince Reverend Mother to help her, and they guilt-trip a helicopter pilot into flying them to Reno.

Deloris, still in her habit but tied up, remains calm and prays for guidance while the nuns dash about the casino, searching for her. Vince's underlings cannot bring themselves to kill Deloris while she wears a habit, and she manages to escape when they untie her to remove the garb. She meets up with the sisters, but as they all head for the exit, Vince and his henchmen find and corner them. Vince orders his men to shoot Deloris, but they still can't bring themselves to kill a nun. Vince angrily sneers that Deloris is "just a broad", and far from being a nun. Reverend Mother passionately defends her, claiming that she has all the qualities of a true nun. The delay proves just long enough for Lt. Souther to shoot Vince through a window before Vince can shoot Deloris. The police arrest the wounded Vince and his associates. As they are led away, Deloris' last "two words" to Vince are, unexpectedly, "bless you". 

The Reverend Mother is emotionally moved at this revelation of character shown by Delores as they both turn to regail their adventure.

Before Deloris returns to her singing career, she leads the nuns in a rendition of "[[I Will Follow Him]]" for the Pope. Sister Mary Robert finally realizes her true potential and sings a solo during the song, and the Pope himself happily claps to the beat. The film ends with the Pope and church patrons giving the choir a standing ovation. The final shot of Deloris at the altar turns into a magazine cover telling her story, headlined "Heaven Helped Me", leading off a montage of covers, and it's revealed that Deloris starts a recording career with "Listen, Sister!", a [[rock and roll]] record, and "Gonna Make You Pray", a [[gospel]] album.

==Production==
Screenwriter [[Paul Rudnick]] pitched "Sister Act" to producer [[Scott Rudin]] in 1987, and it was agreed that [[Bette Midler]] would be best for the lead role.

'''''Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit''''' is a [[1993 in film|1993]] [[comedy film]] starring [[Whoopi Goldberg]]. Directed by [[Bill Duke]], and released by [[Touchstone Pictures]], it is the [[sequel]] to the successful 1992 film ''[[Sister Act]]''. Most of the original cast reprise their roles in the sequel, including [[Maggie Smith]], [[Kathy Najimy]], [[Wendy Makkena]], and [[Mary Wickes]]. 

==Plot==
Sister Mary Patrick ([[Kathy Najimy]]), Sr. Mary Robert ([[Wendy Makkena]]) and Sr. Mary Lazarus ([[Mary Wickes]]) visit Deloris ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]), now starring in a final performance Las Vegas musical about her misadventures in the convent. After the show, the three sisters ask her for help. The sisters are now in the service of St. Francis Academy, a high school Deloris had attended herself, that is run by the diocese and is in danger of closing down. Despite the best efforts of the sisters and staff, the school's administrator, Mr. Crisp ([[James Coburn]]) is working to convince the diocese to close the school, thinking it has better use as a parking lot.  The kids aren't much better, disrespectful and argumentative, and they get so bad, that, according to dialogue, Sister Mary Patrick is driven to frown, twice.  

Deloris initially declines their request, but changes her mind when she hears that Mother Superior ([[Maggie Smith]]) is in a desperate situation. Upon their arrival at St. Francis Academy, Mother Superior asks her to teach music to a class of teenagers who are actually rebellious. At first, the students play tricks on her, hoping to drive her away.  Eventually, they realize that, not only is she more powerful and determined than they are, but she also has something to offer them.  Slowly, the entire class, except Rita Watson, eventually grow to like her. During the course of the school year, Deloris{{ndash}}as Sister Mary Clarence{{ndash}}discovers their singing talent and decides to organize them into a choir.  Nobody but the sisters believes that they can actually pull this off, partly because of the students' lackluster attitude, until one of the students, an overly-talkative expert on African history with a remarkably mousy voice, hits a beautiful high note during "Oh, happy day" that surprises even Deloris.

Deloris obtains use of the school's old music room. As the other sisters help clean it up, they discover old trophies and ribbons the school won from the All-State Music Competition from decades before. They find out the competition still takes place in Hollywood, and they convince Deloris and the students to enter, in the hopes they can save St. Francis from closing if they win. Upon raising the funds for the trip, the choir prepares.  

Meanwhile, Rita Watson ([[Lauryn Hill]]), one of the rebellious students, is discovering her talent as a singer, much to the dismay of her single parent mother ([[Sheryl Lee Ralph]]). Mrs. Watson tries to convince her daughter that there is no future in singing. Rita refuses to go along with Delores' changes to the class, and leaves it for several days.  However, she returns, insistant on her dreams of making as a singer, despite her mother's total opposition.  Faking her mother's consent, Rita goes with the choir to the competition. Finding a note, her mother realizes what Rita has done, and desperately drives to Hollywood to bring her home.  When she gets there, though, Mrs. Watson listens to her daughter sing and discovers that she was wrong; Rita ''does'' have the talent necessary to make it as a musician and be successful, and she is proud of her daughter's performance.  

As the group heads to the competition, the school board discovers that Deloris is actually a Las Vegas showgirl. The board heads after them to withdraw the choir from the competition. The school's principal, Father Maurice ([[Barnard Hughes]]), is greeted by the students who think that he came to support them. Touched by their appreciation and glowing faces, he decides not to withdraw the choir, against the wishes of Mr. Crisp. After Father Ignatius ([[Michael Jeter]]), Father Wolfgang ([[Thomas Gottschalk]]) and Father Thomas ([[Brad Sullivan]]) trap Crisp in a storage closet, held closed by the cook's famous frozen sausage, they all then race to watch the choir perform.  The choir then sings "Joyful, Joyful" in the competition and defeats the previous year champions, thereby saving St. Francis from closure. Mr. Crisp is transferred, with the aide of the Mother Superior, to another place in the archdiocese. Afterward, the choir learns of Deloris's true identity, to which she tells them all, ''"I am not now, nor have I ever been a Las Vegas showgirl...I am a '''headliner!'''"''.  

During the credits, the majority of the cast sings "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" together.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Although not as successful as ''[[Sister Act]]'', it still grossed [[United States dollar|$]]60 million in the [[United States]] and nearly $100 million worldwide. The movie also attracted a much younger audience towards [[Gospel music]], as well as helping to boost [[Lauryn Hill]]'s music career.
