{{Main|History of Indonesia}}
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Banda Aceh's Grand Mosque, Indonesia.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Banda Aceh's Grand Mosque was built around the 12th century.]] -->
Under the influences of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], several kingdoms formed on the islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Java (island)|Java]] from the [[7th century|7th]] to 14th century. The arrival of [[Arab]]s trading in spices later brought [[Islam]], which became the dominant religion in many parts of the archipelago after the collapse of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms.

When the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] came in early [[16th century]], they found a multitude of small states, vulnerable to the Portuguese, and later other [[Europe]]ans wanting to dominate the [[spice trade]]. In the 17th century, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] became the most powerful of the Europeans, ousting the [[Spain|Spanish]] and Portuguese (except for their colony of [[Portuguese Timor]] on the island of [[Timor]]). Dutch influence started with trading by the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), a chartered private enterprise constituting a state in all but name, complete with its own fleet and army, which gradually expanded its influence and grip on political matters. Like the British, the Dutch mainly relied on indirect rule, using traditional native elites as [[vassal]]s, while imposing their will and extracting major income under supervision by their colonial officials. After VOC was dissolved in 1799 by the [[Batavian Republic]] ([[Napoleon_I_of_France|Napoleon's]] Dutch satellite state) and the political instability from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] including partial British occupation, the East Indies were awarded to the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815. Since then, the East Indies were officially ruled as the major colonies of the Dutch crown.

Under the 19th-century Cultivation System (''Cultuurstelsel''), large plantations and forced cultivation were established on Java, finally creating the profit for the Netherlands that the VOC had been unable to produce. In a more liberal period of colonial rule after 1870, the Cultivation System was abolished, and after 1901 the Dutch introduced the Ethical Policy, which included limited political reform and increased investment in the colony.

During [[World War II]], with the Netherlands under [[Germany|German]] [[Military occupation|occupation]], [[Japan]] began a five-prong campaign in December 1941 towards Java and the vital fuel supplies of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Though Japan captured Java by March 1942, it initially could not find any national leader willing to collaborate with the Japanese government against the Dutch. Eventually the Japanese commander ordered [[Sukarno]]'s  release from his prison island, and in July 1942, Sukarno arrived in Jakarta. Sukarno and his colleagues collaborated with the Japanese occupiers. In 1945, with the war drawing to a close, Sukarno was made aware of an opportunity to declare independence. In response to lobbying, Japan agreed to allow [[Sukarno]] to establish a committee to plan for independence. Sukarno and [[Mohammad Hatta]] declared independence on [[17 August]].

Following the defeat of Japan in the World War, the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Netherlands' Army]], at first backed by the [[Allies]], attempted to reoccupy their former East Indies colonies. Indonesia's war for independence lasted from 1945 until [[27 December]], [[1949]] when, under heavy international pressure, the Netherlands acknowledged the independence of Indonesia as a Federation of autonomous states. This federation soon became a republic with Sukarno as president and Hatta as vice president. ''See [[Indonesian National Revolution]]''. It was not until [[16 august]] [[2005]] that the Dutch [[government]] recognised 1945 as the country's year of independence and expressed regrets over the Indonesian deaths caused by the Netherlands' Army.
