is a city and a [[municipal corporation]] in [[East Godavari]] district in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]].

Ing 

The city has a population of about 504,920([[agglomeration]] 803,340) as per 2001 census. This coastal city is witnessing rapid growth thanks to the recently granted [[Special Economic Zone]] status.  It is one of the largest tier-2 cities of India and the fourth largest city in A.P.  The city also has a deep-water [[port]] which is expanding rapidly.

The presence of a small island called [[Hope Island, India|Hope Island ]] about 5 km from Kakinada coast, makes Kakinada a natural Harbor. Prior to construction of the deep water port, the old anchorage port operated for several decades as the largest minor port in India. At present, both deep water port and older anchorage port operate side by side.

==Origin of the name==
* Kakinada is relatively a younger city compared to other major cities in Andhra pradesh. The city itself grew into prominence in the last 300 years after the European settlers arrived here and the British made it an administrative headquarters for the local area they ruled. 

* Several theories exist regarding the origin of the name Kakinada. The most popular and probably correct theory is that the place where the city was built was called 'Kaki nandiwada' during the reign of Nandi kings who ruled prior to the arrival of the Europeans. The name was truncated to Kakinada over the passage of time. 

* The first European [[settlers]] in this port city were the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], followed by the [[British Empire|British]] and then the [[missionaries]] of the [[Canadian Baptist Mission]] in 1874<ref>Frank Byrne, "India: Birthplace of CBM" in ''Mosaic'' a publication of the Canadian Baptist Ministries.  Winter 2008.  p 10.</ref> 

* After Independence, it was renaturalized to Kakinada, although a few organisations established during the British colonial rule retain the old name (''e.g.'', Cocanada Chamber of Commerce).

* Kakinada is known as Second Madras. The original city that includes the central business district is a well planned city that is divided in several grids with main roads that are straight and are parallel which run across the city. 

* Kakinada is famous for the sweet named "Kakinada kaja " 

* Kakinada is the first place in Asia where the Bio Diesel plant is constructed.
