Hi, I fixed [[Template:POTD commons]], it might be easier to use this, because it uses generated lists. [[Special:Contributions/212.123.186.64|212.123.186.64]] 18:30, 14 Mayu 2008 (UTC)

== link to [[Kapampangan (amanu)]] ==

Hi. Just wanted to point at that the link to [[Kapampangan]] on the main page should be a direct one to [[Kapampangan (amanu)]]. [[User:Gdm|Gdm]] 13:18, 6 Eneru 2009 (UTC)

== Small request ==

Hello! I am a Polish wikipedian and I would like to ask you for writing a new article about former Polish President who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 – '''Lech Wałęsa'''. I have looked for his article in your Wikipedia but without success. Polish Wikipedians will be grateful for your help. Thank you so much in advance! PS article in English you can find '''[[w:en:Lech Wałęsa|here]]'''. Best wishes from Poland, [[User:Patrol110|Patrol110]] 20:14, 25 Setiembri 2009 (UTC)
