Marinduque is famous for the annual [[Moriones Festival]].

==People and Culture==
Marinduqueños are of Tagalog origin and speak [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].  However, because of the island's proximity to to the [[Visayas]] region, the Marinduqueño variant of Tagalog has many words that are [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] origin and are not comprehensible to other Tagalog speakers.  Traces of [[Bikol language|Bicolano]] can also be found in this variant.  [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and [[English language|English]] are also well understood.

Marinduqueños are very hospitable in nature and are very welcoming.  One such custom reflecting this is ''putong'', which is a custom of welcoming and honoring friends and visitors.  The honoree (or honorees) are seated and crowned with flowers while local women dance and sing before them.  Other well-wishers throw coins and flower petals for long life.

The [[Moriones Festival|Moriones festival]] also plays a prominent role in Marinduque's culture.
During the month of April, parades and celebrations can be seen on the streets.  In [[Gasan]], [[Boac]], and [[Mogpog]], a parade of people dressed as Moriones can be seen on the main road connecting the towns of the island.  [[Boac]] shows a reenactment in the evening of the actual event when [[Longinus_(Christian_mythology)|Longinus]], a blind soldier, punctures Jesus with his spear and the blood of the Lord restores his sight.

==Economy==
Marinduque is primarily an agricultural province, primarily growing rice and coconuts.  Fishing is also an important part of the economy.  Mining was once an important player in the economy until a mining accident (the Marcopper mining incident) occurred, bringing the industry to a standstill on the island.  The provincial government has just recently sued Marcopper's parent company, [[Placer Dome]], for $100 million in damages.

Tourism still does not play a major role in the economy, but it is growing.

===Physical===

Marinduque is a heart-shaped island between [[Tayabas Bay]] in the north and [[Sibuyan Sea]] to the south. It is separated from the [[Bondoc Peninsula]] in [[Quezon]] by the [[Mompog Pass]]. Some of the smaller islands to the northeast are Maniuayan Island, Santa Cruz Island, and Mompog Island. The highest peak in Marinduque is Mt. Malindig with elevation of 1157 meters.

At the southern island tip is Mount Marlanga, a 3,876-foot high extinct volcano.

The island has two major seasons--the dry season (November through February) and the rainy season (June through October), with a transitional period in between. {{ref|Marinduque}}

==History==
Legend has it that the island of Marinduque was formed as a consequence of a tragic love affair between two people: Marina and Garduke.  Marina's father, a local chieftain, did not approve of this affair and ordered the beheading of Garduke.  Before this could be done, the couple sailed out to sea and drowned themselves, forming the island now called Marinduque.  Other versions of the legend also claim that the island was named "Malindik", named after Marinduque's highest mountain, Mt. Malindig.  When Spanish [[conquistadors]] arrived in the Philippines, they found the name hard to pronounce, which led to the renaming of the island as "Marinduc" and later the current "Marinduque".

During the Spanish and early American occupations, Marinduque was part of the province of Balayan (now [[Batangas province|Batangas]]) in the 16th century, [[Mindoro]] in the 17th century, and had a brief period as an independent province in 1901, when the Americans arrived.  

During the [[Philippine-American War]], Marinduque was the first island to have American [[concentration camps]].{{ref|camps}} Marinduque is the site of the [[Battle of Pulang Lupa]], where Filipino soldiers under Colonel Maximo Abad, defeated a larger better trained force of Americans.

In 1902, the US-Philippine Commission annexed the islands of [[Mindoro]] (now two separate provinces) and [[Lubang]] (now part of [[Occidental Mindoro]]) to the province. 

Four months later, the province became part of the province of Tayabas (now [[Quezon province|Quezon]]).  

On February 21, 1920, [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Act]] 2280 was passed by the Philippine Congress, reestablishing Marinduque as a separate province.
