==Anatomical basics of the human lip==
One differentiates between the '''Upper''' (''Labium superioris'') and '''lower lip''' (''Labium inferioris''). The lower lip is usually somewhat larger. The border between the lips and the surrounding skin is referred to as the ''vermilion border,'' or simply the ''vermilion.'' The vertical groove on the upper lip is known as the [[philtrum]]. The entire skin between the upper lip and the nose is referred to as the "[[ergotrid]]". 

The skin of the lip, with three to five cellular layers, is very thin compared to typical face skin, having up to 16 layers. With light skin color, the lip skin contains no [[melanocyte]] ([[pigment]] cells, which give skin its color). Because of this, the [[blood vessel]]s appear through the skin of the lips, which leads to their notable red coloring. With darker skin color this effect is less prominent, as in this case the skin of the lips contains more melanin and thus is visually thicker. 

The lip skin is not hairy and does not have [[sweat gland]]s or [[sebaceous gland]]s. Therefore, it does not have the usual protection layer of sweat and body oils which keep the skin smooth, kill pathogens, and regulate warmth. For these reasons, the lips dry out faster and become chapped more easily. 

==Anatomy in detail==
The [[skin]] of the lips is [[stratified squamous epithelium]]. The mucous membrane is represented by a large area in the [[somatosensory system|sensory cortex]] and is therefore highly sensitive. The ''Frenulum Labii Inferioris'' is the [[frenulum]] of the lower lip. The ''Frenulum Labii Superioris'' is the frenulum of the upper lip. 






==Functions of the lips==
===Food intake===
Because they have their own muscles and bordering muscles, the lips are very movable. Lips are used for eating functions, like holding food or to get it in the mouth. In addition, lips serve to close the mouth airtight shut, and to hold food and drink inside, and to keep out unwanted objects. Through making a narrow funnel with the lips, the suction of the mouth is increased. This suction is essential for babies to [[breast feed]]. 

===Tactile organ===
The lip has many [[nerve ending]]s  and reacts as part of the tactile (touch) senses.  Lips are very sensitive to touch, warmth, and cold.  It is therefore an important aide for exploring unknown objects for babies and toddlers.

===Articulation===
The lips serve for creating different sounds - mainly the [[labial consonant|labial]], [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] and [[labiodental consonant]] sounds - and thus create an important part of the speech apparatus.  The lips enable whistling and the performing of wind instruments like the trumpet, clarinet, and flute.



==Ding Sakit==
As an organ of the body, the lip can be a focus of disease or show symptoms of a disease:

*Lip [[herpes]] (technically ''Herpes labialis'', a form of [[herpes simplex]]) is a viral infection which appears in the formation of painful blisters at the lip. 
*[[Carcinoma]] at the lips is caused predominantly by using tobacco and overexposure of sunlight. To a lesser extent, it could also come from lack of oral hygiene or poor fitting dentures. Alcohol appears to increase the carcinoma risk of tobacco use. 
*Infections from [[Lip piercing|lip rings]].
