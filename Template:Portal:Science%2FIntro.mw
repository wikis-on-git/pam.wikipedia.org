</div>'''[[Science]]''', in the broadest sense of the term, refers to any system of knowledge attained by verifiable means. In a more restricted sense, ''science'' refers to a system of acquiring knowledge based on [[empiricism#Scientific usage|empiricism]], [[experiment]]ation, and methodological [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], as well as to the organized body of [[knowledge]] humans have gained by such [[research]]. 

[[Scientist]]s maintain that scientific investigation must adhere to the [[scientific method]], a process for properly developing and evaluating natural explanations for [[observation|observable]] phenomena based on [[empirical]] study and independent verification. Science typically, therefore, rejects [[supernatural]] explanations, [[Appeal to authority|arguments from authority]] and biased [[observational studies]].

Fields of science are commonly classified along two major lines: [[Natural science#Natural sciences|Natural sciences]], which study natural phenomena; and [[Social sciences]], which study [[human behavior]] and [[society|societies]]. Whether [[mathematics]] is a science is a matter of perspective. 

Fields of science can be further distinguished as [[pure science]] or [[applied science]]. Pure science is principally involved with the discovery of new truths with less (or no) regard to their applications. Applied science is principally involved with the application of existing truths in new ways.
