The map below should be retained as it is centered nearly perfectly to show the strategic Western connections serviced by the trans-shipments from this city. If A GOOD replacement can be found, fine, but until then, this will do the job... as a picture is worth a thousand words!
-->[[Image:Califate 750.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Early Middle Ages map showing Western trade regions serviced by this ancient and historical port. The gateway city of '''Bharakuccha''' is not deliniated on this map, but the outline of the [[Gujarat]] peninsula and [[Gulf of Khambhat]] mark it's location. The inhospitable mountains and deserts to the north of the [[Arabian Sea|Erythean Sea]] suggest its importance in trade with ancient [[Axum]], or via the sea-land trade routes via the [[Iraq|Tigris-Euphrates]] valley.]]
