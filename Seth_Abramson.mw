The site is home to a compilation of MFA admissions information, including acceptance rates, class sizes, funding data, graduate placement statistics, and application response times. By April 2009, the site had received more than half a million unique visitors since its January 2007 introduction of new [[Master of Fine Arts]] rankings.
