The '''pancreatic duct''', or '''duct of Wirsung''', is a duct joining the [[pancreas]] to the [[common bile duct]] to supply pancreatic juices which aid in [[digestion]] provided by the "[[exocrine]] pancreas". The pancreatic duct joins the [[common bile duct]] just prior to the [[ampulla of Vater]], after which both ducts perforate the medial side of the second portion of the [[duodenum]] at the [[major duodenal papilla]].
