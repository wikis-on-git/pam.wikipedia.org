A bitter independence struggle has been waged by various Muslim factions for five centuries against successive occupiers. Spanish, U.S., Japanese and Filipino government forces failed to quell their desire to separate from the largely Christian nation. Due to influx of immigrants to the region, the majority of Mindanao's population is now predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]], a regional issue that fuels the anger of poor and displaced Mindanaoan Muslims and the separatist movements that have been fighting for hundreds of years.

In recent years, the area has come under scrutiny, with the rise of Islamic terrorist organizations tied to the Middle East conflict. Mindanao is a staging ground for such terrorist groups as [[Abu Sayyaf]] and [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] that undermine the more moderate and nationalistic aspirations of independence seekers like the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF).

As an [[island]] in the southern part of the country, Mindanao is the second largest at 94,630 square kilometers, only about 10,000 km&sup2; smaller than [[Luzon]]. The island is mountainous, and is home to [[Mount Apo]], the highest mountain in the country. To the west of Mindanao island is the [[Sulu Sea]], to the east is the [[Philippine Sea]], and to the south is the [[Celebes Sea]].

The island group of Mindanao encompasses Mindanao island itself, plus the [[Sulu Archipelago]] to the southwest. The island group is divided into six [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]], which are further subdivided into 25 [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]].

==Pulung Aptas ning Mindanao==

The island group of Mindanao is an arbitrary grouping of islands in the southern Philippines which encompasses six [[Regions of the Philippines|administrative regions]]. These regions are further subdivided into 25 [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]], of which only four are not on Mindanao island itself. The island group includes the [[Sulu Archipelago]] to the southwest, which consists of the major islands of [[Basilan]], [[Jolo Island|Jolo]], and [[Tawi-Tawi]], plus outlying islands in other areas such as [[Camiguin]], [[Dinagat Island|Dinagat]], [[Siargao Island|Siargao]], [[Island Garden City of Samal|Samal]], and the [[Sarangani Islands]].

The six regions are listed below and each is individually discussed in the succeeding paragraphs.

* [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] (Region IX)
* [[Northern Mindanao]] (Region X)
* [[Davao Region]] (Region XI)
* [[SOCCSKSARGEN]] (Region XII)
* [[Caraga]] (Region XIII)
* [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM)

'''[[Zamboanga Peninsula]] (Region IX)''', formerly ''Western Mindanao'', is located in the landform of the same name. It consists of the provinces of [[Zamboanga del Norte]], [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]], and two cities&mdash;[[Zamboanga City]] and [[Isabela City]]&mdash;which are independent of any province. Isabela City is the only territory not on Mindanao island itself and is located on [[Basilan]]. The region's new administrative capital is Pagadian City and the whole region used to be a single province named [[Zamboanga]].

'''[[Northern Mindanao]] (Region X)''' consists of the provinces of [[Bukidnon]], [[Camiguin]], [[Lanao del Norte]], [[Misamis Occidental]], [[Misamis Oriental]], plus [[Cagayan de Oro City]]. The province of Camiguin is also an island just of the northern coast. The administrative center and capital of the region is [[Cagayan de Oro City]].

'''[[Davao Region]] (Region XI)''', formerly ''Southern Mindanao'', is located in the southeastern portion of Mindanao. The region is divided into the provinces of [[Davao Oriental]], [[Davao province|Davao]], [[Davao del Sur]], and [[Compostela Valley]]; plus [[Davao City]]. The region encloses the [[Davao Gulf]] to the south and includes the island of [[Island Garden City of Samal|Samal]] in the gulf, and the [[Sarangani Islands]] further to the south. Davao City is the region's administrative center.

'''[[SOCCSKSARGEN]] (Region XII)''', formerly ''Central Mindanao'', is located in the south-central portion of the island. It consists of the provinces of [[Cotabato province|Cotabato]], [[Sarangani]], [[South Cotabato]] (which was used to be part of Region XI), and [[Sultan Kudarat]], plus [[Cotabato City]]. The names of the provinces together with [[General Santos City]] spell the name of the region which is an [[acronym]]. Cotabato City, geographically located in, but not part of [[Maguindanao]] province, is the region's former administrative center. Koronadal City, in South Cotabato, is the new administrative center of the newly formed region.

'''[[Caraga]] (Region XIII)''' is located in the northwestern part of Mindano. Its provinces are [[Agusan del Norte]], [[Agusan del Sur]], [[Surigao del Norte]], and [[Surigao del Sur]]. The administrative center is [[Butuan City]] in Agusan del Norte. The region also covers the outlying islands of Surigao del Norte such as [[Dinagat Island]], [[Siargao Island]], and [[Bucas Grande Island]].

The '''[[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM)''' is a special region which covers the territories predominantly populated by [[Muslim]]s. ARMM has its own government unlike almost all the other regions in the country. It consists of almost the whole of the [[Sulu Archipelago]] ([[Isabela City]] of [[Basilan]] is part of the Zamboanga Peninsula region) and two provinces in the mainland. The provinces located in the Sulu Archipelago are [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], and [[Tawi-Tawi]]. Basilan and Tawi-Tawi are themselves the main islands of their respective provinces, while the main island of [[Sulu]] is [[Jolo Island]]. The mainland provinces are [[Lanao del Sur]] and [[Maguindanao]]. [[Cotabato City]], which is not part of the ARMM, is the region's administrative center.
