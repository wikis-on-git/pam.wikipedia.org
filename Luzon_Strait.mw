Ing '''Luzon Strait''' metung yang [[strait]] a tataid ne ing  [[Dayat Malat ning Filipinas Sea]], king bandang albugan [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], king [[Dayat Malat ning Mauling Tsina]], pilatan ning [[Taiwan]] at [[Luzon]] king [[Filipinas]].

The strait is approximately 250 km wide. It contains a number of islands grouped into two groups: the [[Batanes|Batanes Islands]] of Batanes province and the [[Babuyan Islands]] of [[Cagayan]] province.

The strait is divided into a number of smaller channels. The [[Babuyan Channel]] separates Luzon from the Babuyan Islands, which is separated from the Batanes Islands by the [[Balintang Channel]]. Batanes is separated from Taiwan by the [[Bashi Channel]].

The Luzon Strait was part of the [[Japan|Japanese]] invasion route in December [[1941]]. On [[December 8]] (the same day as the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack, because of the date line), they landed on Batanes.  On [[December 10]], they occupied [[Camiguin Island]] (not the same as the [[Camiguin]] just north of [[Mindanao]]) in a soon-abandoned attempt to establish a seaplane base, and on the same day landed at [[Aparri, Cagayan|Aparri]] on Luzon.

Subsequently, many [[United States|US]] [[submarine]]s hunted Japanese [[convoy]]s passing through the strait on their way from the East Indies to Japan.
