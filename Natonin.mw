The municipality is very mountainous, with very little level ground lending itself to agriculture.  The barangays are geographically isolated by high (700m) mountains covered in jungle.  Transportation throughout Natonin is largly undeveloped roads.  The only paved roads (as of 2007) are in Poblacion proper.  Roads frequently become impassable in the rainy seasons.  Some barangays (notably Maducayan) are inaccesable by road.  Maducayan lies one mile beyond a recent road extension from the center of Saliok to the western most situ of Saliok.

The primary crop is rice, although a lack of arable land, lack of mechanization and no access to fertilizers limits the harvest to a subsistence level only.  Families rely on small livestock populations to supplement the diet.  Fruits and wild coffee are harvested from the forest.  Poblacion boasts of numerous family ponds which raise tilapia for consumption.  Due to the terrain, rice is planted on terraced fields.  Locals consider the rice terraces of Natonin to be equal or surpassing those of Banaue to the south.

The people of Natonin are from two distinct ethnic groups. Most of the population are of Igorot stock. The Madukayyong tribe identifies itself as Igorot, in that they are geographically in Igorot territory, yet many of their traditions and dialects are more closely related to Kalingan.  It could be argued that the Madukayyong are the southernmost Kalingan tribe.  Head hunting was practiced in Maducayan as late as the mid-1930's, and was set aside in favor of Christianity and education after World War II.
