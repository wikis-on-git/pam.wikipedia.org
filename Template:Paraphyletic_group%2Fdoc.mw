=== Usage ===
This template is modelled on [[Template:taxobox]], and uses the parameters listed there.

It can be used for either paraphyletic or polyphyletic groups.

The taxa parameters like regnum, classis, etc are for a taxon which includes all of the organisms in the paraphyletic group (for example [[chordata]] or [[tetrapoda]] in an article for [[reptile]]).  The classification can be omitted if there is no useful way to specify it (for example if some [[cyanobacteria]] are considered to be [[seaweed]]s the only relevant classification on the [[seaweed]] page would be [[Life]]).

It also uses the parameters <code>includes</code> and <code>excludes</code>, intended to list taxa that are or are not included in the group - use either or both according to taste.
