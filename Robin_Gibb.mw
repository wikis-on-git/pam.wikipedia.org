'''Robin Hugh Gibb''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (22 December 1949&nbsp;– 20 May 2012) was a British singer and songwriter. He is best known as a member of the [[Bee Gees]], co-founded with his twin brother [[Maurice Gibb|Maurice]] and older brother [[Barry Gibb|Barry]]. He had another younger brother, [[Andy Gibb]], who was also a very popular solo singer.

Born in the [[Isle of Man]] to English parents, the family later moved to [[Manchester]] before settling in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. Gibb began his career as part of the family trio and when the group found their first success they returned to the [[United Kingdom]] where they achieved worldwide fame. In 2004, the Bee Gees received their [[Commander of the British Empire|CBE]]s from the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] for their "contribution to music".<ref name="CBE">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1463010/Bitter-sweet-trip-to-palace-for-Bee-Gees.html 'Bitter-sweet' trip to palace for Bee Gees].

==Early life==
Born to Barbara and Hugh Gibb<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KugbDQHX0R8C&pg=PT1196&lpg=PT1196&dq=hugh+gibb+march+1992&source=bl&ots=bDFl0k5a5g&sig=n_WjAdfPcetGD0rM0yqCH2b4wsA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HxeTT5a8DYSk8QO6uYzODA&ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=hugh%20gibb%20march%201992&f=false|title=Hugh Gibb|publisher=Books.google.co.uk|accessdate=2012-058-15}}</ref> in the Isle of Man, Gibb was the fraternal twin brother of [[Maurice Gibb]], and the elder of the two, born 35 minutes before Maurice. The third-born of five children, Gibb had one older sister, Lesley (born 1945), and three brothers: [[Barry Gibb|Barry]] (born 1946), twin [[Maurice Gibb|Maurice]] (1949–2003), and [[Andy Gibb|Andy]] (1958–1988).

Gibb was the subject of an edition of the [[BBC]] [[genealogy]] documentary series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (British TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' first broadcast on 21 September 2011. The programme revealed that Gibb's paternal great-grandfather was born into poverty in [[Paisley]] and went on to become a decorated soldier and his paternal great-grandmother was a midwife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0153b9g |title=BBC One – Who Do You Think You Are?, Series 8, Robin Gibb |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-12-20 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref>

Gibb's mother Barbara was born in [[Worsley]], [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]], and in the 1950s the family returned to [[Manchester]], England.<ref name="manchester">{{Cite news|title=Bee Gees honoured at home |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1128036_bee_gees_honoured_at_home |newspaper=Manchester Evening News|date=25 July 2009|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> The family lived on Keppel Road, [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] and it was here that the young Gibb brothers sang together and performed in local theatres.<ref name="manchester"/> In late 1958, the family moved to [[Brisbane]], Australia. The family travelled to Australia on the same ship as Australian musician [[Red Symons]]. The brothers' music careers began in Australia and flourished when they returned to England in 1967.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3753699.stm "Surviving Bee Gees collect CBEs"]. BBC.

==Solo career==
{{See also|Bee Gees}}

Traditionally, Gibb's role in the Bee Gees was [[lead singer]], for which he vied with Barry during the group's first period of British success in the late 1960s. This rivalry eventually prompted Gibb to leave the group and begin a solo career. The final irritant was when Gibb’s song "Lamplight" was relegated to the [[B-side]] of Barry's song "[[First of May (Bee Gees song)|First of May]]". Meanwhile, there were rumours during this period that Gibb was dealing with [[drug abuse]]  problems, leading Gibb's parents to allegedly threaten legal action to make him a [[ward of court]] (the UK age of majority at that time being 21, and he was only 19).

In his solo career, Gibb was initially successful with a Number 2 UK hit, "Saved by the Bell", which sold over one million copies and received a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Maurice played [[bass guitar]] on the song "Mother and Jack", but was subsequently removed from the project by producer [[Robert Stigwood]]. Despite having almost completed a second [[solo album]], ''Sing Slowly Sisters'', Gibb reunited with his brothers, who then revived the Bee Gees. The group came back on a high note, reaching No. 3 on the US charts with the song "[[Lonely Days]]" in 1970. In 1971, the Bee Gees had their first US No.1 hit, "[[How Can You Mend a Broken Heart]]", but after that their popularity started to ebb.

In 1974, with new producer [[Arif Mardin]], the Bee Gees reinvented themselves with the song "Blue-Eyed Soul,". The group now entered their second period of phenomenal success in the [[disco]]-era late 1970s.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/bee_gees/bio.jhtml "Bee Gees Bio"]</ref>

In 1978, Gibb performed on the ''[[Sesame Street Fever]]'' album for the [[Sesame Street]] children's TV program. On the "Sesame Street Fever" [[wikt:title track|title track]], he sang a song called "Trash" for the character [[Oscar the Grouch]], and spoke on at least one other song.

While continuing in the Bee Gees, Gibb also promoted his new solo career. During the 1980s, Gibb released three solo albums (''[[How Old Are You?]]'', ''[[Secret Agent (Robin Gibb album)|Secret Agent]]'', and ''Walls Have Eyes''). These three albums were more successful in Europe than in the UK or US, with ''How Old Are You?'' spawning the hit single "[[Juliet (Robin Gibb song)|Juliet]]". However, Gibb's 1984 single "[[Boys Do Fall in Love]]" did reach the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Magazine top 40 list of hits. Gibb also recorded several extended versions of dance songs, including "Boys Do Fall in Love", "Secret Agent", "Like a Fool" and the rarest, "You Don't Say Us Anymore"; many of these extended versions were released to radio [[disc jockeys]] only.

On 27 January 2003, fifteen days after Maurice died, Gibb released a new solo album, ''Magnet'' in [[Germany]] on [[SPV GmbH]], and worldwide shortly afterwards. ''Magnet'' featured the [[Bee Gees]] song "Wish You Were Here" (from the 1989 album ''[[One (Bee Gees album)|One]]'') in a new acoustic version. The lead single, "Please", had coincidental lyrics about "loss". After Maurice's death, Gibb and Barry again disbanded the Bee Gees; however, in late 2009, the two brothers announced that they would reform and perform again as the Bee Gees whenever they could. In recent years, Gibb sang the vocals to the opening titles to the British [[ITV]] show ''[[The Dame Edna Treatment]]''. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

On 18 May 2008, Gibb released the song "[[Alan Freeman Days]]" in tribute to the Australian DJ [[Alan Freeman]]. The song was issued as a download only track, although a promotional CD was issued by Academy Recordings. In December 2008, "[[Alan Freeman Days]]" was followed by another downloadable song entitled "Wing and a Prayer", which shared the same name as a song from the 1989 ''[[One (Bee Gees album)|One]]'' album. However, the new song was actually a reworking of the song, "Sing Slowly Sisters", that had remained unreleased since 1970.<ref>[http://www.robingibb.com/releases/singles/2008/12/09/wing_and_a_prayer "Wing and a prayer"]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref> Later in December, Gibb issued another song, "Ellan Vannin (Home Coming Mix)", featuring the [[King William's College]] Choir from the Isle of Man. ("Ellan Vannin" is the [[Manx language|Manx]] name for the Isle of Man.)

In 2008, Gibb completed a new solo album entitled ''50 St. Catherine's Drive'', but it was never released. However, in August 2009, a 50-second video clip of "Instant Love" from ''50 St. Catherine's Drive'' appeared as a preview. "Instant Love" was a collaboration with Gibb's son [[Robin-John Gibb|Robin-John]]. A second version of "Instant Love" featuring Robin-John on vocals appeared in a short film called ''Bloodtype: The Search'' in which Robin-John appeared.<ref>[http://www.robingibb.com/secure/audio/instant_love_exclusive_clip?cmdr=auth/ok "Instant Love"]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>

Gibb and Robin-John also wrote the score for ''The [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]] Requiem'', recorded by [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] for the 2012 100th Anniversary of the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the Titanic]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Rachel Kaufman |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1352261/Bee-Gees-singer-Robin-Gibb-61-answers-health-quiz.html |title=Robin Gibb answers health quiz |work=Daily Mail |date=1 February 2011 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref> Gibb was due to attend the piece's premier on 10 April 2012, but his failing health kept him away.<ref name="O'Mahoney 2012">{{cite news|last=O'Mahoney|first=Jennifer|title=Bee Gees' Robin Gibb fights for life with pneumonia|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/bee-gees-robin-gibb-fights-for-life-with-pneumonia-7645606.html|accessdate=14 April 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=14 April 2012}}</ref>

In 2010, Gibb was also a guest mentor on the Australian version of ''[[The X Factor (Australia)|The X Factor]]'', alongside Australian TV host [[Kyle Sandilands]], Australian actor/singer [[Natalie Imbruglia]], Irish singer [[Ronan Keating]], and Australian singer [[Guy Sebastian]].

==Collaborations==
In August 2003, Gibb announced the release of a new single of "My Lover's Prayer", a song first recorded by the Bee Gees in 1997, with vocals by Gibb and singers [[Wanya Morris]] and [[Lance Bass]]. "My Lover's Prayer" was played on the radio, but was never actually released. In October 2003, Gibb recorded a second version of this song as a duet with singer [[Alistair Griffin]], a runner-up in the UK television program ''[[Fame Academy 2|Fame Academy]]'' on which Gibb had appeared as a judge. In January 2004, the new "[[Bring It On/My Lover's Prayer|My Lover's Prayer]]" was released in the UK as a double A side CD single. It eventually reached number 5 in the UK music charts.

In January 2005, Robin joined his brother Barry and several other artists under the name ''[[One World Project]]'' to record a charity single in aid of Asian [[tsunami]] relief, titled "Grief Never Grows Old". Other artists who performed on the single included [[Boy George]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Jon Anderson]], [[Rick Wakeman]], [[Sir Cliff Richard]], [[Bill Wyman]], [[America (band)|America]], [[Kenny Jones]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]], [[Russell Watson]] and [[Davy Spillane]].

In June 2005, Gibb joined [[The X Factor (television series)|X Factor]] runner up band [[G4 (band)|G4]] at a sell-out concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, singing the Bee Gees song "First of May". In December 2005, a recording of this performance was released as part of a double A side single, credited as "G4 feat Robin Gibb" together with G4's [[cover version]] of the [[Johnny Mathis]] song  "When a Child is Born". "First of May" also appeared on the platinum selling album ''G4 & Friends'', which reached number 6 in the UK album charts.

In November 2006, Gibb released an album of [[Christmas carol]]s called ''Robin Gibb – My Favourite Carols'', backed by [[The Serlo Consort]], a London choir. [http://www.serloconsort.co.uk/ The Serlo Consort]. The album also featured a new song by Gibb called "Mother of Love", which was released in Europe as a download single. The song was inspired by Maurice and was Robin's first new composition since Maurice died. Gibb donated all [[royalties]] from "Mother of Love" to the "[[BKWSU|Janki Foundation for Global Healthcare]]", and dedicated the song to [[BKWSU|Dadi Janki]], the organisation's spiritual leader. Gibb dedicated the album to his mother, Barbara Gibb. ''Robin Gibb – My Favourite Carols''has a bonus [[DVD]] disc titled ''A Personal Christmas Moment with Robin Gibb''.

Gibb went back to the top of the UK charts in 2009 when he collaborated with singers [[Ruth Jones]], [[Rob Brydon]], and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] on a new version of "[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]", written by Robin,  Barry, and Maurice. The new version, inspired by the [[BBC]] comedy TV show ''[[Gavin & Stacey]]'', was created to benefit the charity [[Comic Relief]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Up for Discussion |url=http://www.billboard.com/news/u2-comic-relief-top-u-k-charts-1003951684.story#/news/u2-comic-relief-top-u-k-charts-1003951684.story |title=Comic Relief Top UK Charts |work=Billboard  |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>

On 20 November, it was revealed that Gibb had been battling [[liver cancer]] diagnosed several months earlier. A source close to the singer stated that his condition was "not good" and his wife, Dwina, had not left his bedside. His brother Barry and his wife Linda, as well as their mother Barbara and Robin's children, Melissa and Spencer, flew to the UK to be with him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/most-popular/2011/11/20/brave-bee-gee-robin-gibb-is-battling-liver-cancer-115875-23574414/ |title=Bee Gee Robin Gibb: frail singer is battling liver cancer |work=Daily Mirror  |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref>

In an interview published in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' on 22 January 2012, Gibb spoke for the first time of the cancer.
<blockquote>"For more than 18 months, I had lived with an inflammation of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]; then I was diagnosed with [[colon cancer]], which spread to the [[liver]]. I have undergone [[chemotherapy]], however, and the results&nbsp;— to quote my doctor&nbsp;— have been 'spectacular'. It’s taken a toll, naturally, but the strange thing is that I've never felt seriously ill. I’ve mostly felt great. There have been many false claims around, which I'd like to dispel. I am not and have never been 'at death's door'. Nor do I have a team of [[Alternative medicine|alternative]] doctors working on my health. That's not true, although I'm not averse to healthy remedies for any illness. I feel they can go together with conventional medicine. I do eat [[health food]]s and drink [[herbal tea]]s made for me by Dwina, my wife and RJ's mother. Other than that, I am under the care of Dr. Peter Harper at [[The London Clinic]]".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2089867/Robin-Gibb-How-obsession-Titanic-helped-save-life.html?ITO=1490 |  title = 'How my obsession with the Titanic has helped save my life,' says cancer-stricken Robin Gibb working with his son on orchestral requiem to those who perished | newspaper = Mail On Sunday | location = London | date = 22 January 2012 | accessdate =22 January 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

Music historian [[Paul Gambaccini]] described Gibb as "one of the major figures in the history of British music" and "one of the best white soul voices ever", while he noted that the Bee Gees were "second only to Lennon and McCartney as the most successful songwriting unit in British popular music".<ref name=bbc_death/> Gibb's death left his brother Barry as the only surviving original member of the Bee Gees.

==Awards==
In 1994, Gibb was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] at the [[Grammy Museum]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. In 1997, the Bee Gees were inducted as a group into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], US. At the [[1997 BRIT Awards]] held in [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]], London on 24 February, the Bee Gees received the award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.<ref>[http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1997 1997 Brit Awards] Brits.co.uk.
