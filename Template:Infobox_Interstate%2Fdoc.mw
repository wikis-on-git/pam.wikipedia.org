'''''For intrastate Interstates, use {{tl|Infobox Interstate/Intrastate}}.'''''

This is the basic syntax you need to get a complete routebox on the article page, just place this before any other text and fill in the variables. Copy and paste the following code from the box, not the source. Any parameters that do not apply to a particular route can be omitted.

For the above parameters here's what you should fill in:

* '''article_route:''' This is the number of the Interstate the article is about (ex. 70)
* '''type:''' Main (2di), Auxiliary (3di), or Future
* '''map:''' Name of map over at Wikimedia Commons
* '''length_mi:''' This is the length of the route in miles.  If you specify beyond integers (i.e. add a decimal value) you will need to set the following parameter, length_round
* '''length_round:''' If your value for ''length_mi'' is a whole number, you can omit this.  Otherwise it needs to be set to the decimal precision of the ''length_mi'' parameter.
* '''length_ref:''' To do what a good article writer should, provide your reference for the length of the route using standard &lt;ref&gt; method.  For example: <nowiki><ref name="nyr">[http://www.gribblenation.net/nyroutes/ind/500_599.htm#590i New York Routes - Interstate 590]</ref></nowiki>
* '''length_notes:''' For any notes regarding the length.
* '''year_established:''' This is the date the route was commissioned, assigned to its current alignment, or completed
* '''city:''' ''For beltways only'' -  Name of the city that the Interstate is in
* '''direction_a:''' This should be either '''south''' or '''west''' to keep in accordance with the U.S. Roads parent project, which lists termini and junctions in progression travelling from West to East and South to North.
* '''terminus_a:''' This is where the route begins and is either at the '''southern''' terminus or '''western''' terminus.
* '''junction:''' See [[WP:IH]] for directions regarding this parameter.
* '''direction_b:''' The opposite of ''direction_a''
* '''terminus_b:''' Where the route ends, in accordance with the guidelines set forth with starting_terminus
* '''browse:''' ''For intrastate Interstates only'' -  Browse lines can be added here using the <nowiki>{{XX browse}}</nowiki> templates. See [[WP:IH]] for a full explanation regarding these templates.

By completing the infobox as follows, you'll get a routebox like the one to the upper right.
