'''Japan''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 日本, '''Nihon''' or '''Nippon''', literally "sun source") is an [[East Asia]]n [[country]] surrounded by the [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Sea of Japan]], the [[Philippine Sea]], the [[East China Sea]], and the [[Sea of Okhotsk]]. To the west is [[Korea]] ([[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea|South]]), to the north [[Russia]], and to the southwest [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Taiwan]].

One of the world's leading industrialized countries, the "[[Names of Japan|Land of the Rising Sun]]" is composed of over 3,000 islands. The largest and main islands are, from north to south, [[Hokkaido|Hokkaidō]], [[Honshu|Honshū]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Kyushu|Kyūshū]]. The [[Ryukyu Islands]], including [[Okinawa]], are southwest of the main islands.

===Amlat Bayu Misulat===
[[Image:MiddleJomonVessel.JPG|thumb|left|160px|A Middle [[Jomon]] vessel (3000 to 2000 BC)]]

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] research indicates that the earliest inhabitants of the [[Japanese archipelago]] migrated over land bridges from [[Northeast Asia]] about 30,000 years ago. Other evidence also suggests that some may have later come by sea from [[Southeast Asia]] during a period of migration toward the [[Pacific Ocean]].

The first signs of civilization appeared around [[10th millennium BC|10,000 BC]] with the [[Jomon]] culture, characterized by a [[Mesolithic]] to [[Neolithic]] semi-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle of pit dwelling and a rudimentary form of [[agriculture]]. [[Weaving]] was still unknown and clothes were often made of [[bark]]. Around that time, however, the Jomon people started to make [[clay]] vessels, decorated with patterns made by impressing the wet clay with braided or unbraided cord and sticks (Jomon means "patterns of plaited cord"). This led to the manufacture of [[pottery]].

The start of the [[Yayoi]] period around 300 BC, marked the influx of new technologies such as [[rice]] farming, [[shamanism]], and [[iron]] and [[bronze]]-making brought by migrants from [[Korea]] and [[China]]. These formed the basic elements of traditional Japanese culture, still seen today. As the population increased and society became more complex, they wove cloth, lived in permanent farming villages, constructed buildings of wood and stone, accumulated wealth through landownership and the storage of grain, and developed distinct social classes.

The Yayoi period was succeeded around [[250|250 AD]] by the [[Kofun era]], characterized by the establishment of strong military states centered around powerful clans. The [[Yamato]] court, concentrated in the [[Asuka]] region, suppressed the clans and acquired agricultural lands, increasing their power. Based upon the Chinese model, they developed a central administration and an imperial court system and society was organized into occupation groups ([[Ritsuryo]]). Most people were farmers; others were fishermen, weavers, potters, artisans, armorers, and ritual specialists.

===Classical era===
[[Image:TodaijiDaibutsu0224.jpg|thumb|160px|The Great [[Buddha]] at [[Todaiji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], originally cast in 752]]
The Japanese did not start writing their own histories until the 5th and 6th centuries, when the [[Chinese written language|Chinese writing system]], [[Buddhism]], advanced [[pottery]], ceremonial burial, and other aspects of culture were introduced by aristocrats, artisans, scholars, and monks from [[Baekje]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].

The beginning of Japanese historical writing culminated in the early 8th century with the massive chronicles, [[Kojiki]] (The Record of Ancient Matters, 712) and [[Nihonshoki]] (Chronicles of Japan, 720). Though Japan did not appear in written history until 57, when it is first mentioned in Chinese records as the nation of "[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]" (in Chinese, "Wo"), or "dwarf state", these chronicles tell a much different and much more legendary history of Japan, deriving the people of Japan from the gods themselves.

According to traditional Japanese mythology, Japan was founded in the 7th century BC by the ancestral Emperor [[Jinmu]], a direct descendant of the Shinto deity [[Amaterasu]]. It is claimed that he started a line of emperors that remains unbroken, to this day. However, historians believe the first emperor who actually existed was Emperor [[Ojin]], though the date of his reign is uncertain. Nonetheless, for most of Japan's history, real power has been in the hands of the court nobility, the [[shogun]]s, the military, or, more recently, prime ministers.

Through the [[Taika Reform Edicts]] of 645, Japanese intensified the adoption of Chinese cultural practices and reorganized the government in accordance with the Chinese administrative structure. This paved the way for the dominance of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosophy in Japan until the 19th century.

The [[Nara period]] of the 8th century marked the first strong Japanese state, centered around an imperial court, in the city of Heijo-kyo (now [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]). The imperial court later moved briefly to [[Nagaoka]], and later Heian-kyo (now [[Kyoto]]), starting a "golden age" of classical Japanese culture called the [[Heian Period|Heian period]] which lasted for nearly four centuries and was characterized by the regency regime of the [[Fujiwara clan]].

===Medieval era===
Japan's [[medieval]] era was characterized by the emergence of a ruling class of [[warrior]]s, the [[samurai]]. In the year 1185, general [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] was the first to break the tradition of ruling alongside the emperor in Kyoto, holding power in distant [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. After Yoritomo's death, another warrior clan, the [[Hojo clan|Hojo]], came to rule as regents for the [[shogun]]s. The shogunate managed to repel [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions from [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongol-occupied]] [[Korea]] in 1274 and 1281. The [[Kamakura shogunate]] lasted another fifty years. Its successor, the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], was much weaker, and Japan soon fell into warring factions. The "Warring States" or [[Sengoku period]] ensued.

[[Image:NanbanGroup.JPG|thumb|160px|A group of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Nanban]] foreigners, 17th century]]

During the 16th century, traders and [[missionary|missionaries]] from [[Portugal]] reached Japan for the first time, initiating the ''[[Nanban trade period|Nanban]]'' ("southern barbarian") period of active commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West (and even China). During the last quarter of this century, [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] established increasingly strong control over the warring states of Japan. Toyotomi reunified the country, and following his death, Tokugawa seized power by defeating his enemies at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, moving the capital to [[Edo]] (now [[Tokyo]]) and founding the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. 

The Tokugawa shogunate, suspicious of the influence of [[Catholic]] missionaries, barred all relations with Europeans, except for severely restricted contacts with [[the Netherlands|Dutch]] merchants at the [[artificial island]] of [[Dejima]], near [[Nagasaki]]. They also became more conscious of trade with China, especially after the [[Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing Dynasty]]. The Manchus subjugated Korea in 1637, and the Japanese feared an invasion. Thus, the country became more isolated than ever before. This period of isolation lasted for two and a half centuries, a time of tenuous political unity known as the [[Edo period]], considered to be the height of Japan's medieval culture.

===Modern era===
[[Image:Japanese_Empire2.png|thumb|240px|The Empire of Japan encompassed most of East and Southeast Asia at its height, in 1942]]

In 1854, [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Matthew Perry]] of the United States forced the opening of Japan to the West with the [[Convention of Kanagawa]]. The perceived weakness of the shogunate led many samurai to revolt, leading to the [[Boshin War]] of 1867 to 1868. Subsequently, the shogunate resigned, and the [[Meiji Restoration]] returned the emperor to power. Japan adopted numerous Western institutions during the [[Meiji period]], including a modern government, legal system, and military. These reforms helped transform the [[Empire of Japan]] into a world power, defeating [[China]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Russia]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. By 1910, Japan controlled [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and the southern half of [[Sakhalin]].

The early 20th century saw a brief period of "[[Taisho democracy]]" overshadowed by the rise of [[Japanese expansionism]]. [[World War I]] enabled Japan, which fought on the side of the victorious [[Allies]], to expand its influence in [[Asia]], and its territorial holdings in the Pacific. In 1936, however, Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], joining with Germany and Italy to form the [[Axis]] alliance. During this period, Japan invaded China, occupying [[Manchuria]] in 1931, and continued its expansion into [[China proper]] in 1937, starting the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], which lasted until the end of World War II. In 1941, after US [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] demanded that Japan withdraw its forces from China, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the United States naval base in Pearl Harbor]] as well as [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonies in [[Southeast Asia]], bringing itself and the [[United States]] into [[World War II]]. After a long campaign in the [[Pacific Ocean]], Japan lost its initial territorial gains, and American forces moved close enough to begin [[strategic bombing]] of [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], and other major cities, as well as the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing]]s of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. The Japanese eventually agreed to an unconditional surrender to the Allies on [[August 15]], [[1945]] ([[V-J Day]]). The [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal]] was convened on [[May 3]][[1946]] to prosecute [[Japanese war crimes]], including atrocities like the [[Nanking Massacre]]. Emperor [[Hirohito]], however, was given immunity and retained his title.

The war cost millions of lives in Japan and other countries, especially in [[East Asia]], and left much of the country's industries and infrastructure destroyed. Official [[Occupied Japan|American occupation]] lasted until 1952, although [[United States Forces Japan|U.S. forces]] still retain important bases in Japan, especially in [[Okinawa]]. In 1947, Japan adopted a new [[pacifism|pacifist]] [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]], seeking international cooperation and emphasizing human rights and democratic practices. 

After the occupation, under a program of aggressive industrial development and U.S. assistance, Japan achieved spectacular growth to become one of the largest economies in the world. Despite a major [[stock market crash]] in 1990, from which the country is recovering gradually, Japan remains a global economic power today and is now bidding for a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]].

{{main|Geography of Japan}}

Japan, a country of [[island]]s, extends along the eastern or [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[Asia]]. The main islands (sometimes referred to as the Home Islands), running from north to south, are [[Hokkaido Prefecture|Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]] (or the mainland), [[Shikoku]], and [[Kyushu]]. [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]] on [[Okinawa Honto|Okinawa]], in the [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyu]] archipelago, is over 600 km to the southwest of Kyushu. In addition, about 3,000 smaller islands may be counted in the full extent of the [[archipelago]] that comprises greater Japan.

*Area: 377,835 km&sup2; (including 3,091 km&sup2; of territorial water)
*Major islands: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku
*Coastline: 29,751 km
*Highest peak: [[Mount Fuji]]: 3776&nbsp;m (12,385&nbsp;ft)
*Lowest elevation: Hachinohe Mine -130&nbsp;m (-426&nbsp;ft)

Japan is the 18th most densely populated country in the world (see also the [[list of countries by population density]]). About 73% of the country is [[mountain]]ous, and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial, or residential use, due to the generally steep elevations, climate, and risk of landslides caused by earthquakes, soft ground, and heavy rain. This has resulted in an extremely high population density in the habitable zones that are mainly located in coastal areas.

Japan is situated in a [[Volcano|volcanic]] zone on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], at the juncture of the [[Philippine Plate]], [[Pacific Plate]], [[Eurasian Plate]], and [[North American Plate]]. Frequent low-intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive [[earthquake]]s, often resulting in [[tsunami]]s, occur several times each century. Twenty percent of the world's earthquakes magnitude 6.0 and higher are epicentered in Japan. The most recent major quakes include the [[2004 Chuetsu Earthquake]] and the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin Earthquake]] of [[1995]]. [[Onsen|Hot springs]] are numerous, and have been developed as resorts.

{{main articles|[[Religions of Japan]] and [[Japanese mythology]]}}

The Japanese people's concern towards religion is mostly related to [[mythology]], [[traditions]], and neighborhood activities rather than the source of morality or the guideline for one's life, for which sometimes [[Confucianism]], or even [[Taoism]], tends to serve as the basis for the moral code. When asked to identify their religion, most would profess to believe in either [[Shintoism]] (54%) or [[Buddhism]] (40%), for simple reasons like their family has belonged to some sect of Buddhism or to avoid contention with religious foreigners. Nonetheless, most of the people are not [[atheist]]s, and the tendency is often identified with [[syncretism]], [[secularism]], and even [[irreligion]]. This results in a variety of practices such as parents and children celebrating [[Shinto]] rituals, students praying before exams, couples holding a wedding at a [[Christian]] church and funerals being held at [[Buddhist]] temples. A minority profess to [[Christianity]] (0.7%) and other religions (4.7%) like [[shamanism]], [[Islam]], and [[Hinduism in Japan|Hinduism]]. Also, since the mid-19th century, many religious sects called [[Shinkosyukyo]], and later [[shinshukyo]], emerged.

===Education===
{{main|Education in Japan}}



===Language===
{{main|Japanese Language}}

Japanese language is an [[agglutinative]] language that belongs in the the [[Altaic languages|Altaic language]] family. It is distinguished by a system of [[Japanese honorifics|honorifics]] reflecting the [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary which indicate the relative status of speaker and listener. 

Modern Japanese is written with a mix of [[Chinese character|Chinese characters]] ([[kanji]]) and a modified [[syllabary]], [[kana]], also originally based on Chinese characters. Japanese texts may also include [[Romanization of Japanese|rōmaji]] (letters from the Latin alphabet) as well as various special symbols. [[Japanese writing system|Written Japanese]] has been heavily influenced by [[Chinese language|Chinese]] although Chinese language itself belongs in a different language family. Much vocabulary also has been imported from Chinese, or created on Chinese models.

The oldest surviving book written in Japan is the [[Kojiki]] ([[712]]). It was written in a mixture of Chinese, used both ideographically, phonetically, and otherwise to create Japanese meanings. The oldest surviving Japanese book written in [[hiragana]] is the ''Tosa Diary'' ([[935]]) by [[Ki no Tsurayuki]]. [[Japanese literature]] reached a high point during the 11th century with the ''Genji Monogatari'' (''[[The Tale of Genji]]'') by Lady [[Murasaki Shikibu]]. Many other Japanese literary works were also written by women.

===Culture===
[[Image:Japanese traditional dancer cropped.jpg|thumb|A Japanese traditional dancer]]
{{main|Culture of Japan}}

Japanese culture has evolved greatly over the years, from the country's original [[Jomon]] culture to its contemporary hybrid culture, which combines a number of influences from Asia, Europe, and America.

Historically, China and Korea have been the most influential starting with the development of the [[Yayoi]] culture from around 300&nbsp;BC and culminating with the introduction of rice farming, ceremonial burial, pottery, painting, writing, poetry, etiquette, the [[Chinese written language|Chinese writing system]], and [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]] by the 7th century AD. In the pre-modern era, Japan developed a distinct culture, in its [[Japanese Art|arts]]: ([[ikebana]], [[origami]], [[ukiyo-e]]), [[Japanese crafts|crafts]] ([[Japanese traditional dolls|dolls]], [[Lacquer|lacquerware]], [[Japanese pottery|pottery]]), performances ([[bunraku]], [[Japanese traditional dance|dance]], [[kabuki]], [[noh]], [[rakugo]]), traditions ([[List of Japanese games|games]], [[onsen]], [[sento]], [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], [[Japanese architecture|architecture]], [[Japanese garden|gardens]], [[Katana|swords]]), and [[Cuisine of Japan|cuisine]].

From the mid-19th century onward, Western influence prevailed, with American influence becoming especially predominant following the end of [[World War II]]. This influence is apparent in Japan's contemporary popular culture, which combines Asian, European, and, 1950-onward, American influences in its [[fashion]], [[Cinema of Japan|films]], [[Japanese literature|literature]], [[Japanese television programs|television]], [[Computer and video games|video games]], and [[Music of Japan|music]].  Also, the Japanese are the largest spenders of money on luxury goods in the world.  Today, Japan is a major exporter of such culture, which has gained popularity around the world, particularly in the other countries of East Asia. Especially notable contributions of modern Japan to the rest of the world include [[anime|animation (anime)]] and [[manga|graphic novels (manga)]]. Japanese culture has attracted many devotees in Europe and North America as well.
