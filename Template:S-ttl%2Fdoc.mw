This template creates a single succession box center column to be used with [[Template:S-start/doc|succession boxes]] for the function of listing titles.

==Usage==

The format is <code><nowiki>{{</nowiki>s-ttl|title=''enter title here''|years=''enter years title was held here''|''parameter=''}}</code>, where ''parameter='' can be used optionally for any of the additional parameters listed in the following table. 

:''district'' &mdash; For use with parliamentary offices.  Insert as a wikilink the district represented during the tenure in office.
:''regent1 (or regent 2, or regent 3)'' AND ''years1 (or years2, or years3)'' &mdash; These parameters can be used when an office is held in tandem with another person.  Examples of this include co-rulers of a country or region and regencies.  It does not include consorts or sub-positions such as vice presidencies.  The "years" parameter should only contain years, not days or months, but all other guidelines rules apply.
:''alongside'' &mdash; This parameter is reserved for political positions where two people share power, such as US senators.
:''lords'' &mdash; Designates that the person was a member of the House of Lords.  The parameter is asking for the dates they served in the house.
:''creation'' &mdash; Adds a sub-line beneath the title that allows for a "creation" number for certain noble titles (such as the Dukes of Cornwall).
:''dynasty'' &mdash; Adds a sub-line beneath the title that allows for a "dynasty" number for certain royal dynastic lines (such as the Pharaohs of Egypt).

This template allows for multiple row-spans using the parameter |rows=| between the template name and the first parameter.
