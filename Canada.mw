'''Canada''' is a [[country]] occupying the northern portion of [[North America]], and is the world's [[List of countries by area|second largest]] country in total area.

Inhabited for at least ten millennia by [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples]], Canada was founded as a union of [[British colony|British colonies]], some of which had earlier been [[French colonial empire|French colonies]].  A [[federation|federal]] [[dominion]] of ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] with three [[Provinces and territories of Canada#Territories of Canada|territories]], Canada peacefully obtained its sovereignty in a process beginning 1867 from its last colonial possessor, the [[United Kingdom]].

Today, Canada is governed as a [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]]. Canada's [[head of state]] is its [[Monarchy in Canada|monarch]], who is represented in Canada by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]].  The head of government is the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]]. The most recent federal [[Canadian federal election, 2006|general election]] was held on [[January 23|23 January]] [[2006]].

Canada defines itself as a [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] and [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] nation. Both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Canadian French|French]] are official languages of the country. In the early [[1970s]], Canada began to adopt policies based on the concepts of cultural diversity and multiculturalism.  Many Canadians now view this as one of the country's key attributes.

A technologically advanced and industrialized nation, Canada is a net exporter of energy because of its large fossil fuel deposits, [[nuclear energy]] generation, and [[hydroelectric power]] capacity. Its diversified [[Economy of Canada|economy]] relies heavily on an abundance of natural resources and trade, particularly with the [[United States]], on which it arguably depends for its security and with which it has had a long and complex relationship.

==Canada's name==
[[Image:Canada Parliament2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Parliament Hill]], [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]].]]
{{main|Canada's name}}  
The name ''Canada'' is believed to come from the [[Wyandot|Huron]]-[[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois]] word ''kanata'', which means "village" or "settlement". In 1535, locals used the word to tell [[Jacques Cartier]] the way to [[Stadacona]], site of present-day Quebec City. Cartier used Canada to refer not only to Stadacona, but also to the entire area subject to Donnacona, Chief at Stadacona; by 1547, maps began referring to this and the surrounding area as Canada.

{{main|Language in Canada}}

*English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions.
*Any defendant in a criminal case has the right to a trial in either English or French.
*The public has the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French.
*Official language minority groups in most provinces and territories have the right to be educated in their language, in their own schools, with their own elected school boards, where they exist in sufficient numbers.
*While multiculturalism is official policy, to ''become'' a citizen one must be able to speak either English or French.
*More than 98% of Canadians speak English or French or both.

While the nation remains officially bilingual, the majority of Canadians are fluent only in English. 

The official language of Quebec is French, as defined by the province's [[Charter of the French Language]], which was introduced by the [[Parti Quebecois]] in 1976. However, the charter also provides certain rights for speakers of English and aboriginal languages. Quebec provides most government services in both French and English. 

French is mostly spoken in [[Quebec]] with pockets in [[New Brunswick]], eastern and northern [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], and southern [[Manitoba]]. In the 2001 census, 6,864,615 people listed French as a [[first language]], of whom 85% lived in Quebec.  17,694,835 people listed English as a first language.

New Brunswick is the only officially bilingual province, a status specifically guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Some provincial governments, notably Manitoba and Ontario, offer many services to their French minority populations.

Several [[Canada#Aboriginal peoples|aboriginal]] languages have official status in the [[Northwest Territories]]. [[Inuktitut]] is the majority language in [[Nunavut]] and has official status there.

Non-official languages are also important in Canada, with 5,470,820 people listing a non-official language as a first language. (The above three statistics include those who listed more than one first language.) Among the most important non-official first language groups are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (853,745 first-language speakers), [[Italian language|Italian]] (469,485), [[German language|German]] (438,080), and [[Punjabi]] (271,220).

[[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scots Gaelic]] were spoken by many immigrants that settled in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Newfoundland]]. Newfoundland was the only place outside Europe to have a whole Irish Dialect, [[Newfoundland Irish]], and the to have a distinct name in Irish, Talamh an Éisc meaning 'land of the fish'. The Irish language is rare in Newfounland now. In Nova Scotia, Scots Gaelic still has 500-1,000 fluent speakers. Scots Gaelic also mixed with [[Cree]] to form the [[Bungee language]]. At one point a motion was tabled in [[Canadian Parliament| Parliament]] that Gaelic (Scottish Gaelic and Irish not having been seen as distinct at the time) be made the third official language of the Dominion, but did not pass.

==Aboriginal peoples==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Fontaine.jpg|thumb|right|[[Phil Fontaine]], the current National Chief of the [[Assembly of First Nations]] representing [[aboriginal peoples in Canada]].]] -->
{{main|Aboriginal peoples in Canada}}
The [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution Act of 1982]] recognizes three groups of [[aboriginal peoples in Canada]]: the "Indians" (their legal designation, but now usually called [[First Nations]]), [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]]. The aboriginal population is growing almost twice as fast as the rest of the population in Canada. According to the [[Canada 2001 Census]], people identified themselves as aboriginal numbered 976,305 people (or 3.3% of Canada's population) of whom about 62% are First Nations, 30% are Métis, and 5% are Inuit. Also, ethnic origin figures from the Census show that 1.3 million Canadians stated that they were partially or fully of aboriginal ancestry, including about one million people claiming full or partial First Nation ancestry, 307,000 Métis ancestry and 56,000 Inuit ancestry.

==Culture==
[[Image:CanCup87.jpg|thumb|left|Ice hockey events like the [[World Cup of Hockey]] (formerly Canada Cup) are popular in Canada.  [[Ice hockey]] originated in Canada when residents began playing [[Hurley]] on ice.]]
