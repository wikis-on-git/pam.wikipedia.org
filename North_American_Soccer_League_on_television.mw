Beginning in [[1975 North American Soccer League season|1975]], the league final was called the [[Soccer Bowl]].

===National Professional Soccer League (1967)===
In 1967, two professional soccer leagues started in the United States: the [[FIFA]]-sanctioned [[United Soccer Association]], which consisted of entire European and South American teams brought to the US and given local names, and the unsanctioned [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|National Professional Soccer League]]. The National Professional Soccer League had a national television contract in the U.S. with the [[CBS]] [[television network]] (which signed a two-year contract to broadcast a game every Sunday afternoon live and in color). The NPSL kicked off on Sunday, April 16 with a full slate of five matches. However, the ratings for matches were unacceptable even by weekend daytime standards and the arrangement was terminated. [[Bill MacPhail]], head of [[CBS Sports]], attributed NASL's lack of TV appeal to empty stadiums with few fans, and to undistinguished foreign players who were unfamiliar to American soccer fans.<ref name="sportsillustrated.cnn.com">Sports Illustrated, Soccer Is Getting A Toehold, August 30, 1976, http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1091476/index.htm</ref>

[[Play-by-play]] voice [[Jack Whitaker]] was joined by the former [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] international [[Danny Blanchflower]] as a [[pundit (expert)|pundit]]. Blanchflower was not impressed with the standard of play and did not hesitate to say so.<ref>[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1135457/index.htm Maule, Tex. "Kickoff For A Babel Of Booters," ''Sports Illustrated'', April 24, 1967.]</ref>  The NPSL was also criticised after Pittsburgh's 2–1 triumph over Toronto in the Falcons' home opener on Sunday, May 14. Of the twenty-one fouls that afternoon, eleven were called to allow CBS to insert [[television advertisement|commercials]] into its telecast. Referee Peter Rhodes also admitted that he had forced players to fake injuries to serve the same purpose. This raised many questions about whether the [[television network]]s and its [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] were having too much influence over televised sporting events.

The leagues merged in 1968 to form the '''North American Soccer League''' (NASL). It has been suggested that the timing of the merge was related to the huge amount of attention given throughout the [[English (language)|English]]-speaking world to the victory by [[England national football team|England]] in the [[Football World Cup 1966|1966 FIFA World Cup]] and the resulting [[documentary film]], ''Goal''. While the [[United States Soccer Federation|USSF]] and [[FIFA]] refused to recognize the NPSL, the television contract with [[CBS]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=1968 CBS North American Soccer League PROMO (NASL)|id=2R-ZJPXG3_I}}</ref> guaranteed some element of financial stability.

===Controversy===
[[Toronto Croatia]] played in the [[Canadian National Soccer League|National Soccer League]] until 1975 when they purchased the [[Toronto Metros]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]] to form '''[[Toronto Metros-Croatia]]'''. During this period the team attracted many soccer stars, such as Portuguese superstar [[Eusébio]], and were successful enough that they won [[Soccer Bowl]] '76 – a 3–0 win over the [[Minnesota Kicks]] – at the [[Kingdome]] in [[Seattle]].  The championship team was coached by Marijan Bilić, an immigrant to Canada who had played for [[Dinamo Zagreb]]. The champions' team was: Paolo Cimpiel, [[Ted Polak]], Željko Bilecki, [[Ivan Lukačević]], [[Robert Iarusci]], [[Eusébio]], Mladen Cukon, [[Carmine Marcantonio]], Ivair Ferreira, Wolfgang Suhnholz, [[Damir Sutevski]], [[Ivan Grnja]], [[Filip Blašković]] and Chris Horrocks.<ref>[http://nasljerseys.com/images/Metros/Metros-Croatia%2076%20Road%20Team%202.jpg NASL] 1976 Champions - Toronto Metros</ref>

However, the [[North American Soccer League|NASL]] was never comfortable with the [[Croatia]] link (an obvious [[ethnic]] connection).  League executives lobbied CBS to ensure they were only referred to as Toronto at the Soccer Bowl on television.

===The Pelé effect===
It was during the 1975 season that the [[New York Cosmos (1970–85)|New York Cosmos]] acquired the Brazilian star [[Pelé]], whom they had been attempting to sign since the team was created. [[Steve Ross (businessman)|Steve Ross]] had apparently not heard of him before getting involved in soccer, but agreed to finance the transfer when [[Clive Toye]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=1984-10-01 NASL Soccer Bowl Game 1 Chicago Sting vs Toronto Blizzard Second Half|id=z6c_ae9nASo}}</ref> compared the Brazilian's popularity to that of [[Pope John Paul II|the Pope]]. Pelé joined the Cosmos on June 10, 1975 on a salary of $1.4&nbsp;million per year, an enormous wage for an athlete at that time. A number of contracts—only one of which mentioned soccer—were set up for Pelé to ensure that he paid the lowest amount of tax possible, including one as a "recording artist" with Warner subsidiary [[Atlantic Records]]. "We owned him lock, stock and barrel," Toye retrospectively boasted.

Pelé's arrival created a media sensation and overnight transformed the fortunes of soccer in the USA. The Pelé deal was later described by Gavin Newsham, an English writer, as "the transfer coup of the century".<ref name=newshamguardian/> His arrival turned the Cosmos from a motley crew of foreigners, semi-professionals and students into a huge commercial presence. The club's groundsman, on hearing that the Brazilian's début for New York was to be broadcast on [[CBS]], spray-painted the pitch green to disguise how little grass was on it: the match, against the [[Dallas Tornado]], was broadcast to 22 countries and covered by more than 300 journalists from all over the world.<ref name="newshamguardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/jun/10/sport.comment|title=When Pele and Cosmos were kings|date=2005-06-10|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=[[London]]|publisher=Guardian News & Media| first=Gavin| last=Newsham| accessdate=2011-01-20}}</ref> From the moment he signed his contract at the [[21 Club]] on 10 June 1975 in front of ecstatic [[Steve Ross (Time Warner CEO)|Steve Ross]] and a crush of worldwide media, the player's every move was followed, bringing attention and credibility to the sport in America. As previously mentioned, his debut NASL match five days later versus the Dallas Tornado at the dilapidated [[Downing Stadium]] on [[Randall's Island]] was broadcast live on [[CBS]] network—the first regular-season NASL match on US network TV in six years.

It was the Cosmos' tenth match of the [[1975 North American Soccer League season|season]] and led by the Brazilian, who recorded an assist and a goal; New York came back from two goals down for the 2–2 final score. The contest was also Pelé's first competitive match in eight months since his last outing with [[Santos FC]] in October 1974. He would eventually end up with five goals in his debut season during which his biggest challenge became figuring out how to fit into this team of journeymen players with abilities far inferior to his. Still his biggest impact was on the sport in New York and the rest of America as Cosmos' home attendance got tripled in just half the season he was there. They also played in front of huge crowds on the road since everyone wanted to see Pelé - towards the end of the season when he pulled a hamstring and couldn't suit up, 20,000 fans in Philadelphia showed up just to see him in street clothes. Furthermore, the league's profile got raised as other NASL teams - encouraged by Ross' investment in Pelé and the prominence his arrival brought to the Cosmos franchise - started bringing over more big-name aging foreign stars such as [[George Best]] who was about to turn 30, 31-year-old [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]], 34-year-old [[Geoff Hurst]], and 35-year-old [[Bobby Moore]].

===Commentators===
*[[Paul Gardner (journalist)|Paul Gardner]] - Gardner was the color commentator for the first-ever live telecast in the United States of a World Cup final, in 1982 on ABC. He also served as ABC color commentator with [[Jim McKay]] for NASL games in 1979-81. He also did commentary for NBC (1986 World Cup), CBS (NASL) and ESPN (college), and has been a film producer and was the scriptwriter and soccer adviser for the award-winning instructional series ''Pele: The Master and His Method'' in 1973.<ref>http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n50-15259</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=Hefty Tribute Fit for a Sport's King|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E7DD153EF93BA25752C1A9609C8B63&scp=17&sq=%22Paul%20Gardner%22%20soccer&st=cse|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 18, 2006}}</ref>
*[[Frank Glieber]] - In 1963, Glieber began a long career with [[CBS Sports|CBS]] television. Over the next two decades he would broadcast a variety of events for the network including [[NFL on CBS|NFL]] football, [[NBA on CBS|NBA]] and [[College Basketball on CBS|NCAA basketball]], professional [[bowling]], [[tennis]], [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|NASL soccer]], and [[PGA Tour on CBS|golf]] (including the [[Masters Tournament]] each spring). Glieber continued to broadcast local Dallas area sports events during his time at CBS, working as many as sixteen hours a day.
*[[Mario Machado]] - He was the voice of soccer for the CBS television network in 1968 and in 1976, covering the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL). He hosted the weekly soccer program, ''The Best of the World Cup'' for the Spanish International Network.  Machado hosted ''Star Soccer'' from England on [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) [[Public television]] stations for six years.
*[[Seamus Malin]] - He also worked with the [[North American Soccer League|NASL]]'s [[Boston Minutemen]] and [[New York Cosmos (1971–1985)|New York Cosmos]]. He also called World Cup matches for NBC, ABC, and Turner Network Television, plus matches on CBS when the network had NASL rights.
*[[Jon Miller]] - His first network exposure came in 1976, when he was selected by [[CBS]]-TV to broadcast the NASL Championship Game. From 1974&ndash;1976, Miller did play-by-play for the [[Washington Diplomats]] of the NASL. He also announced the ''Soccer Game of the Week'' for nationally syndicated [[TVS Television Network|TVS]] from 1977&ndash;1978.

==TVS Television Network and Mizlou Television Network (1977–1978)==
[[Soccer Bowl '78]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=1978 08 27 Tampa Bay Rowdies vs New York Cosmos Soccer Bowl|id=pOlONUTXAdI}}</ref> was broadcast live in the United States on the [[TVS Television Network|TVS]] network.

[[Mizlou Television Network|Mizlou]] produced the first "live" coast-to-coast satellite feed, of a [[New York Cosmos (1971–1985)|New York Cosmos]] soccer game, from [[San Jose, California]] to [[WOR-TV]] in New York in the late 1970s.

==ABC (1979–1981)==
In [[1979 North American Soccer League season|1979]], [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] began covering the NASL in a deal that called for 9 telecasts of league games, including the playoffs and [[Soccer Bowl]]. In 1979, the team from the "Village of Vancouver", the Whitecaps (a reference to ABC TV sportscaster [[Jim McKay]]'s observation that "Vancouver must be like the deserted village right now", with so many people watching the game on TV) beat the powerhouse [[New York Cosmos (1971–1985)|New York Cosmos]] in one of the most thrilling playoff series in NASL history to advance to the [[Soccer Bowl]]. In the Soccer Bowl<ref>{{YouTube|title=1979-09-08 VANCOUVER WHITECAPS VS TAMPA BAY ROWDIES SOCCER BOWL|id=m6jPp2Ky4PE}}</ref>, they triumphed against the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975–1993)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] in a disappointed [[New York City]].

===Decline===
On October 1, 1977, Pelé closed out his legendary career in an exhibition match between the Cosmos and Santos. Santos arrived in New York and New Jersey after previously defeating the [[Seattle Sounders (1974–83)|Seattle Sounders]] 2–0. The match was played in front of a capacity crowd at [[Giants Stadium]] and was televised in the United States on [[Wide World of Sports (US TV series)|ABC's ''Wide World of Sports'']]<ref>{{YouTube|title=Friendly Match 1977: Santos x Cosmos New York|id=Fn1IrvelRLU}}</ref> as well as throughout the world. After the retirement of Pelé in 1977, much of the progress that American soccer had made during his stay was lost; there was no star at the same level to replace him as the NASL's headline act. After enduring briefly during the late 1970s, attendances dropped after 1980. The sport's popularity fell and the media lost interest. The deal with broadcaster [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to broadcast NASL matches was also lost in 1980, and the 1981 [[Soccer Bowl]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=1981 Soccer Bowl - Chicago Sting - New York Cosmos (Highlights)|id=lVm87SgZKJk}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|title=1981 09 26 CHICAGO STING VS NEW YORK COSMOS SOCCER BOWL PART 1 NASL|id=idMrjtrd5mY}}</ref> was only shown on tape delay. All of the franchises quickly became unprofitable, and a salary cap enforced before the 1984 season only delayed the inevitable.

==ESPN and USA Network (1981–1984)==
{{see also|Soccer on ESPN}}

In the last few years of its existence, the NASL did manage to get some games on a new cable sports network that had begun in 1979 called [[ESPN]]. In 1981, they signed a contract to broadcast 20 games on Saturdays. The new [[USA Network]] also carried games, usually on Wednesday<ref>{{YouTube|title=1982 08 18 Tulsa Roughnecks at New York Cosmos|id=Laanz7V6s3s}}</ref> nights.

===Major Indoor Soccer League===
The 1982–83 [[Major Indoor Soccer League (1978–1992)|Major Indoor Soccer League]] season was the fifth in league history and would end with the [[San Diego Sockers (1978–96)|San Diego Sockers]] winning their first MISL title. It would be the Sockers' second straight indoor championship, as the club had won the [[1981–82 NASL Indoor season|North American Soccer League]]'s indoor league the previous spring.

The league would enter into an agreement with the NASL in the summer of 1982 to begin plans for an eventual merger.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |title=NASL, indoor league announce merger|date=August 11, 1982|publisher=[[Vancouver Sun]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=taFlAAAAIBAJ&pg=3861,175302&dq=nasl+indoor&hl=en|page=C2|accessdate=2012-01-27}}</ref> Initial plans to have all 14 NASL teams play in the winter would not come to pass, as most teams preferred to concentrate on the outdoor season. However, the [[Chicago Sting]] and [[Golden Bay Earthquakes]] would join the Sockers for the MISL season.

The MISL continued to make inroads on national television. While the spring would see the end of the league's two-year deal with the [[USA Network]], CBS would broadcast a playoff game live from Cleveland on May 7 that drew an estimated four million viewers.

With the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|NASL]] near death in the summer of 1984, a handful of teams made plans to switch from outdoor to [[indoor soccer]] once the NASL season ended in October.<ref>{{cite news |last=Miranda |first=Randy |title=Four NASL squads will play in MISL |newspaper=[[Lakeland Ledger]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Q9QvAAAAIBAJ&pg=5145,3596493&dq=nasl+misl&hl=en |page=D1 |date=August 10, 1984 |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref> Along with the Sockers, the [[Chicago Sting]], [[Minnesota Strikers]] and [[New York Cosmos (1971–1985)|New York Cosmos]] formally made the leap in late August.<ref>{{cite news |title=MISL takes four NASL teams |newspaper=[[Boca Raton News]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YaZYAAAAIBAJ&pg=4506,9574674&dq=nasl+misl&hl=en |page=2C |date=August 31, 1984 |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref> With the addition of the [[Dallas Sidekicks (1984–2004)|Dallas Sidekicks]], the league went back to a 14-team, two-division setup.

This would be the final year the MISL would have games aired on network television, CBS broadcast Game 4 of the championship series live on May 25.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sarni |first=Jim |title=Blast For Soccer Fans: CBS Airs MISL Game |newspaper=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-05-25/sports/8501200962_1_misl-all-star-game-cbs-radio-american-cable |page= |date=May 25, 1985 |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref>
