===European settlement===
External visitors including [[Vinland|the Norse]] had arrived before, but it was not until after the discovery voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the late 1400s and early 1500s that European nations began to explore the land in earnest and settle there permanently. 

During the 1500s and 1600s, the Spanish settled parts of the present-day [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and [[Florida]]. The first successful English settlement was at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1607. Within the next two decades, several Dutch settlements, including [[New Amsterdam]] (the predecessor to [[New York City]]), were established in what are now the states of [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. In 1637, [[Swedish colonization of the Americas|Sweden established a colony]] at [[Fort Christina]] (in what is now Delaware), but lost the settlement to the Dutch in 1655.

This was followed by extensive British settlement of the east coast. The British colonists remained relatively [[Benign_neglect|undisturbed]] by their home country until after the [[French and Indian War]] when the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and its North American Colonies fought against [[France]] and its North American Colonies. The war resulted in [[France]] ceding [[Canada]] and the [[Great Lakes]] region to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[Spain]] gaining Louisiana in compensation for its loss of [[Florida]] to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. 

Later that year, the British government under [[George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom|George III]] issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 that placed a boundary upon the westward expansion of the British North American colonies. The Proclamation's goal was to force colonists to negotiate with the Native Americans for the lawful purchase of the land and, therefore, to reduce the costly frontier warfare that had erupted over land conflicts. 

To pay for the North American war a tax was imposed, as it was becoming increasingly difficult for the crown to pay for its military excursions and the defence of the American colonies from native uprisings. The colonists widely resented the taxes as they were denied representation in the [[British Parliament]]. Tensions between Britain and the colonists increased, and the thirteen colonies eventually rebelled against British rule.

===Nationhood===
[[Image:George-Washington.jpg|thumb|150px|left|First [[President of the United States]] under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], [[George Washington|George Washington (1789-1797)]].]]

In 1776, the 13 colonies [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|declared independence]] from Great Britain and formed the United States, the world's first constitutional and democratic [[federal republic]].  The [[American Revolutionary War]] followed (1775 to 1783). 

Before the ratification of a national government, the United States existed as an informal alliance of independent individual colonies with their own laws and sovereignty, while the [[Second Continental Congress]] was given the nominal authority by the colonies to make decisions regarding the formation and funding of the [[Continental Army]] but not to levy taxes or make federal law.

The first united national political structure was a [[confederation]] proposed in 1777, and ratified in 1781 as the [[Articles of Confederation]]. After long [[Federalist papers|debate]], this was supplanted in 1789 by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], which formed a more centralized [[federalism|federal]] government.

===Civil War===
From early colonial times, there was a shortage of labor, which encouraged [[unfree labor]], particularly [[indentured servitude]] and [[slavery]]. By the mid-19th century, a major division over the issue of [[states' rights]] and the expansion of slavery came to a head.

The northern states had become opposed to slavery, while the southern states saw it as necessary for the continued success of southern [[agriculture]] and wanted it expanded to newer territories in the West. Several federal laws were passed in an attempt to settle the dispute, including the [[Missouri Compromise]] and the [[Compromise of 1850]].

The dispute reached a crisis in 1861, when seven southern states seceded [[Confederate States of America#International Diplomacy and Legal Status|<small><sup>1</sup></small>]] from the Union and formed the [[Confederate States of America]], leading to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Soon after the war began, four more southern states seceded, and two states had both Union and Confederate governments.

During the war, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], mandating the freedom of all slaves in states in rebellion.  However, full emancipation did not take place until after the end of the war in 1865, the dissolution of the Confederacy, and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] took effect. The Civil War effectively ended the question of a state's right to secede, and is widely accepted as a major turning point after which the federal government became more powerful than state governments.

===Expansion===
[[Image:Westward the Course of Empire.jpg|right|thumb|300px|American westward expansion is idealized in [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s famous painting ''Westward the Course of Empire Takes its Way'' (1861). The title of the painting, from a 1726 poem by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]], was a phrase often quoted in the era of [[Manifest Destiny]], expressing a widely held belief that civilization had steadily moved westward throughout history.

==Geography and climate==

===Geography===
[[Image:USA-satellite.jpg|thumb|right|335px|A satellite composite image of the [[continental United States|contiguous United States]].  [[Deciduous]] vegetation and [[grassland]]s prevail in the east, transitioning to [[prairies]], [[boreal]] forests, and the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] in the west, and [[desert]]s in the southwest.  In the northeast, the coasts of the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Atlantic seaboard]] host much of the country's population.]]
{{main|Geography of the United States}}
The United States shares land borders with [[Canada]] (to the north) and [[Mexico]] (to the south), and [[Territorial waters|territorial water]] boundaries with Canada, [[Russia]], the [[Bahamas]], and numerous smaller nations.  It is otherwise bounded by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Bering Sea]], in the west; the [[Arctic Ocean]], in the northernmost areas; and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the [[Caribbean Sea]], in the eastern and southeastern areas.  

Forty-eight of the states are in the single region between Canada and Mexico; this group is referred to, with varying precision and formality, as the ''continental'' or ''contiguous'' ''United States'', sometimes abbreviated ''CONUS'', and as the ''[[Lower 48]]''.  [[Alaska]], which is not included in the term ''contiguous United States'', is at the northwestern end of [[North America]], separated from the Lower 48 by Canada.  The state of [[Hawaii]] is an [[archipelago]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The capital city, [[Washington, District of Columbia]] is a federal district located on land donated by the state of [[Maryland]].  ([[Virginia]] also donated land, but it was returned in 1847.)  The United States also has [[Political divisions of the United States#Territories of the United States|overseas territories]] with varying levels of independence and organization.

In total area (which includes inland water and land), only [[Russia]] and Canada are larger than the United States; if inland water is excluded, [[China]] ranks second, the U.S. ranks third, and Canada ranks fourth.  The United States' total area is 3,718,711 [[square_mile|square miles]] (9,631,418 [[square kilometre|km²]]), of which land makes up 3,537,438 square miles (9,161,923 km²) and water makes up 181,273 square miles (469,495 km²).

{{main|Demographics of the United States}}


====Ethnicity and race====
{{main|Racial demographics of the United States}}

The United States is a very racially [[diversity|diverse]] country. According to the 2000 census, it has 31 ethnic groups with at least one million members each, and numerous others represented in smaller amounts.

The majority of Americans descend from [[white]] [[Europe|European]] immigrants who arrived after the establishment of the first colonies (most after [[Reconstruction]]). This majority--69% in 2000--decreases each year, and is expected to become a [[plurality]] within a few decades. The most frequently stated European ancestries are [[German peoples|German]] (15.2%), [[Irish people|Irish]] (10.8%), [[English people|English]] (8.7%), [[Italian people|Italian]] (5.6%) and [[Scandinavian]] (3.7%). Many immigrants also hail from [[Slavs|Slavic]] countries such as [[Poland]] and [[Russia]]. Other significant immigrant populations came from eastern and southern Europe and French Canada.

[[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanics]] from [[Mexico]] and [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]] are second only to the German-American population. Hispanics comprise 13% of the population (2000 census). People of Mexican descent made up 7.3% of the population in the 2000 census, and this proportion is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades.

Approximately 12.9% (2000 census) of the American people designated themselves as Black alone or in combination with some other race([[African American]]). [[African Americans]] are spread throughout the country, but their proportional population is largest in the [[Southern United States|South]]. 

[[Asian Americans]], including [[Native Hawaiians]] and [[Pacific Islanders]], are a third significant minority (4% of the population in 2000). Most Asian Americans are concentrated on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and [[Hawaii]]. The largest groups are immigrants or descendants of emigrants from the [[Philippines]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Vietnam]], [[South Korea]], and [[Japan]].

[[Indigenous peoples in the United States]], such as [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]s and [[Inuit]], make up 1% of the population (2000 census). About 35% live on [[Indian reservations]].

For the first time ever, American citizens were able to list all of the [[racial]], [[ethnic]], or [[ancestry]] groups which they felt was appropriate for them. For example, a dual ancestry person was counted in the Italian and the Irish ancestry group or a [[biracial]] person was counted in the White and Black groups.  

{{seealso|Immigration to the United States}}

====Religion====
{{main|Religion in the United States|Demographics of the United States#Religious Affiliation}}
There is no official Religion in the United States, but polls estimate that 80 percent of Americans are [[Christian]]s of various denominations. While Christianity is growing in America, it is not growing as fast as the general population resulting in a 10 per cent decline from 90 percent as recently as 1990. About 2 percent of Americans follow [[Judaism]]. The other 18 percent is comprised of people of no religion and other religions, such as [[Hinduism in the United States|Hinduism]], [[Islam]], and [[Buddhism in the United States|Buddhism]].  The largest single sect of Christianity in the United States is Roman Catholicism (about 26%), followed by the Baptist Christian faith (about 18%).

==Language==
{{main|Languages in the United States}}

The United States does not have an [[official language]] at the federal level. [[English language|English]] is the language generally used for official pronouncements, though there is legislation that assists non-English speakers, such as the [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:HR04312:|TOM:/bss/d102query.html| Voting Rights Language Assistance Act of 1992], which prohibits covered States and political subdivisions from providing English-only voting materials.
