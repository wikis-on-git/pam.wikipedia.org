==Vice Presidency==

[[Image:Php_bill_200_back.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The [[EDSA II Revolution]] that catapulted Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to power is depicted on the [[Philippine peso bills|200-peso bill]].]]
[[Image:Sin2001.jpg|right|thumb|Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide Jr]] officiating Arroyo's oath-taking ceremony during the [[EDSA II|Second People Power Revolution]].]]
Arroyo began her term as Vice President on [[June 30]], [[1998]]. Shortly after, she was appointed by Estrada to the Cabinet as Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development, where her main duty was to oversee the government's social programs for the poor. 

She resigned from the Cabinet in October [[2000]], distancing herself from President Estrada, who was accused of corruption by a former political supporter. Arroyo joined the [[civil society]] and many Filipinos in calling for the president's resignation.

On [[January 20]], [[2001]], after days of political turmoil and street protests, the Supreme Court declared the presidency vacant. The military and the national police had earlier withdrawn their allegiance to Estrada and shifted it to Arroyo. Arroyo would be sworn in the same day as the 14th president of the Philippines by Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide Jr]].

The ouster of Estrada would later be known as [[EDSA II]], after the [[EDSA Revolution]] of 1986 that brought down the administration of [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. EDSA is a reference to Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, a highway in metropolitan Manila that was the main site of the demonstrations.

Estrada later questioned the legitimacy of the High Court's declaration when he sought to reclaim the presidency but the Supreme Court upheld the legitimacy of Arroyo's succession. Even though Estrada and his adherents never recognized Arroyo as the rightful president, she was still able to wield all the powers and privileges of the presidency. The international community also recognized Arroyo as President of the Philippines.

==Presidency: first term (2001-2004)==

[[Image:meetarroyo2.jpg|thumb|260px|Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo with [[Jasmine Trias]]]]
Arroyo's succession to the presidency divided the country between her and Estrada's supporters and as such her first term was hounded by questions of illegitimacy from the political opposition even though the Supreme Court had already decided on the matter. On the other hand, the overwhelming victory of her political allies and the rejection of many Estrada-affiliated politicians in the elections of May 2004 was considered by many to be virtual recognition of her presidency by the electorate.

Her biggest challenge was to reform a government perennially perceived to be corrupt. She found it hard to fulfill this daunting task because of attempts by Estrada's supporters and her political enemies to undermine her leadership. 

On [[May 1]], [[2001]], thousands of supporters of deposed President Estrada, marched to the presidential palace and demanded the release and reinstatement of Estrada, who was earlier arrested on charges of plunder. The protesters refused to be pacified and violence ensued. Arroyo declared a state of rebellion and many protesters, including prominent political leaders, were arrested. The state of rebellion was lifted after a few days, when the threat to Arroyo's government died down.

On [[July 27]], [[2003]], she faced another apparent rebellion when renegade junior officers and their followers mutinied and seized a hotel and shopping mall in the business district of [[Makati City]] in [[Metro Manila]]. Arroyo delivered a televised warning to the renegades and threatened hostile action if they did not surrender. Senator Rodolfo Biazon, a former general, was requested to talk to the mostly young, rebel soldiers. They surrendered soon after it became apparent that they would be attacked by government forces. The mutiny was rumored to have been connected to Estrada and his supporters. A former aide of Estrada has been arrested in connection with the uprising. The President formed the Feliciano Commission to investigate the mutiny. The commission later found that the rebellions, dubbed the ''Oakwood Mutiny'' (named after the hotel the rebels seized), was planned and not spontaneous. It was obviously an attempt to bring down the Arroyo Government. The connection to Estrada, however, was never proven.

On [[August]] [[2003]], Arroyo's husband, Jose Miguel, was accused of corruption by [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Panfilo Lacson]]. The senator alleged that the [[First Lady|First Gentleman]] siphoned off campaign funds and contributions to a bank account under the fictitious name, "Jose Pidal". The accusations were never legally substantiated.

==2004 election==

[[Image:gloria_arroyo_with_bush.jpg|thumb|285px|Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo with George W. Bush]]
Despite announcing in [[Baguio City]] on [[December 30]], [[2002]], that she would not contest the [[Philippine general election, 2004|presidential elections of 2004]], Arroyo changed her mind and decided to seek a new six-year term. During a large gathering in her home province [[Pampanga]], Arroyo declared that she has decided to "defer her retirement," citing the growing clamor from her supporters to run in the election. Because of this turnaround, her popularity rating suffered. 

The 2004 election was seen as a chance for Arroyo to solidify the credibility of her administration, which was marred by questions of legitimacy since its 2001 rise to power. Arroyo fought a bitter campaign with the opposition candidate and Estrada's best friend, popular film actor [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]] She was commonly seen as the intellectual heavyweight, as opposed to Poe, who did not finish high school. Other candidates were former Senator [[Raul Roco]], Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]], and Evangelist [[Eduardo Villanueva]].

Arroyo lagged behind Poe in the polls prior to the campaign season, but her popularity steadily climbed to surpass Poe's. This success was later attributed to her political machinery, the K4 Coalition dominated by the LAKAS Party (She assumed co-chairmanship of LAKAS with De Venecia in 2002); her choice of running mate, the popular senator, [[Noli De Castro]]; her endorsement by influential religious groups; and the loyal support to her by provinces such as [[Cebu]] and Pampanga, among others.

As predicted by the polls, she won the presidential election of [[May 10]], [[2004]], with a margin of more than a million votes over her closest rival, Poe. 

Accusations on the use of taxpayers' money for her campaign funds came out during the campaign when the national elections were in full swing. She, like Estrada before her, was also charged with plunder and corruption for the alleged use of public funds for her campaign. Arroyo's victory was also marred by accusations of cheating from her rivals. Minor irregularities were discovered during the elections but cheating and corruption on a nationwide scale not been proven by the president's accusers.

==Presidency: second term (2004-present)==

Congress proclaimed Arroyo the winner of the election on [[June 24]], [[2004]], more than a month after election day. This makes her only the fourth Philippine president to be re-elected and only the third to a second term (Presidents Quirino and Garcia, serving the unexpired terms of their predecessors, were elected to the presidency in 1949 and 1957 respectively; Presidents Quezon and Marcos were reelected to second terms in 1941 and 1969 respectively).

She took her oath of office on [[June 30]], [[2004]], on the island of [[Cebu]], the first Philippine President to be inaugurated there. This was done in gratitude for the support given to her by the people of Cebu during the election. In a break with tradition, she delivered her inaugural address in Manila before departing for Cebu for her inauguration.

=== The De Castro-Soliman Issue ===

Issues of political patronage immediately began to swirl around the president when rumors that VP-elect Noli de Castro would be taking over as Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development, replacing incumbent Secretary Dinky Soliman. Soliman, an ardent supporter of President Arroyo during the campaign in the urban poor areas, announced in a tearful press conference that she felt betrayed. Several weeks later, De Castro formally said he would not accept the DSWD post. 

=== Angelo de la Cruz Episode ===

On [[July 20]], [[2004]], President Arroyo ordered that the small contingent in Iraq sent by the Phillipines be withdrawn immediately after Angelo de la Cruz was taken hostage by the terrorist group headed by Jordanian-born terrorist [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]. The Filipino contingent was scheduled to withdraw from Iraq in August of that year but the President withdrew earlier than expected, giving in to the terrorists' demands in order to save the life of Cruz. President Arroyo said "...when it comes to showing off to the world, and the life of a Filipino citizen, the life of our citizens come first." Arroyo faced much international criticism for this action, especially from the United States and members of the coalition in Iraq, including from Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]]. Prime Minister Howard said, "It is not showing off when you continue to fight in Iraq after a terrorist incident against your country. It is an international obligation that you are expected to fulfill." Arroyo later counterpointed this statement by saying that the U.S. government and others in the coalition in Iraq held no regard for the lives of their citizens.

=== Election rigging scandal ===

''See main article - [[Philippine electoral crisis, 2005]]'' 
[[Image:Ph2-062705.jpg|250px|thumb|In a televised address, Arroyo admitted speaking to an election offical, but denied cheating.]]
On [[June 10]], [[Samuel Ong]], a former deputy director of the country's National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said that he is a source of a set of original audio tapes of a wiretapped conversation between President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and an official of the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]]. The contents of the tape allegedly proves, according to Ong, that the [[Philippines general election, 2004|2004 national election]] was rigged by Arroyo and that she is not the real winner of the said election. (see complete [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Complete_Transcript_of_Wiretap_Conversations_with_Gloria_Macapagal_Arroyo transcript] of alleged conversations). On [[June 27]], Arroyo admitted to inappropriately speaking to a Comelec official, but denied influencing the outcome of the election.

On [[July 8]], ten appointed cabinet officials filed their irrevocable resignation and asked the president to do the same. Later that day, the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] and former president [[Corazon Aquino]], both former allies of the president, joined calls for her resignation. Arroyo again affirmed her rejection of these calls.

Former president [[Fidel Ramos]] has remained an ally of the president, strongly rejecting calls for her resignation and suggest an immediate constitutional change and proposes a shift from unitary-presidential to federal-parliamentary type of government.
