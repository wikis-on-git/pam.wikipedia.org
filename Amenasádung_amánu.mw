Guest Speaker

Ladies and Gentlemen, mga kababayan,
I'm honored to be here sa inyong harapan;
As a Guest Speaker nang inyong Aguman
To save and propagate Wikang Kapampangan.

I would like to begin by saying sa inyo
I love Kapampangan, native tongue ko ito;
It's my ardent desire since my boyhood, you know
To see Kapampangan not just survived, but grow. 

Kanyan ne tikdo ing tau Kasulukan,
Saguli mu pu Sir, nganang tinambayan,
Kasanting na ata ning kekong sasabian,
Kapampangan ye ba ming aintindian!

What's Up

Shay! What's up Lolo, tila busy yata
Dine sa probinsya  panay ang paggawa;
We came here to see you and to invite you nga
To have a vacation with us in  Menila.

In Manila Lolo, there are so mush to see,
Casinos, Malls, Buildings; Parks that are so pretty;
If you prefer Lolo, you can go watch movie
or you can just stay home, relax, and watch TV.

Aray ku pu Inkong!!!!!!Kasikit yu pindut
ining balugbug ku bigsu nya meputut!
Aba! Ustu palang maplas ka balugbug
You talk Kapampangan no english-tagalug!


Save Kapampangan

Para mai-save ya ing amanung sisuan
Dapat langan kimut every Kapampangan,
And you, as a writer, ing dapat mung daptan
you must keep on writing ban atin pamasan.

Tell those who can declaim to do the declaiming
Tell those who can publish to do the publishing;
Tell those who carry tune to do all the singing
Tell the Politician to please, please do something. 

Koya, nganing wali, tutu ing sabi yu
Dapat itamu ngan maki tungkul tamu;
Nanu neman, koya, ing peka tungkul mu?
Wali ko, I just did, telling you what to do!
