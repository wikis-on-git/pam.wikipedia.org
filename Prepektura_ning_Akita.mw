{{nihongo|'''Akita Prefecture'''|秋田県|Akita-ken}} is located in the [[Tōhoku Region]] of northern [[Japan]]. The capital is the city of [[Akita (city)|Akita]].

== History ==
Separated from the principle Japanese centres of commerce, politics, and population by several hundred kilometres and the Ou and Dewa mountain ranges　to the East, Akita remained largely isolated from Japanese society until after the year 600CE.  Populated principally by the [[Ainu]] people, Akita was a region of hunter-gatherers and principally nomadic tribes.  The first historical record of Akita-ken dates to 658CE, when the General Abe no Hirafu (阿部比羅夫) conquered the native Ezo tribes at Akita city and Nushiro.  Hirafu, then governor of the Koshi region (the Northwest part of Honshu island bordering the Sea of Japan), established a fort on the Mogami river, and thus began the Japanese settlement of the region.

In 733, a new military settlement--later renamed Akita Castle (秋田城)--was built in modern-day Akita city at Takashimizu, and more permanent roads and structures were developed.  The region was used as a base of operations for the Japanese empire as it drove the native Ezo people from northern Honshu.

Shifting hands several times in the interim, during the [[Tokugawa]] shogunate it was appropriated to the Satake family in 1602, who ruled the region for 260 years, developing the agriculture and mining industries that are still predominant today.  Throughout this period, it was classified as part of [[Dewa Province]], and remained politically quite stable.  In 1871, during the Meiji Restoration, Dewa province was reshaped and the old [[daimyo]] regions (called "han") were abolished and administratively reconstructed, resulting in the modern-day borders of Akita.

The famous [[Heian period]] [[Waka (poetry)|waka]] poet, [[Ono no Komachi]], is said to have been born here (but the true location of her birth is uncertain).

== Geography ==
Located in the north of Honshū Island, Akita Prefecture faces the [[Sea of Japan]] in the west and is bordered by [[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]] in the north, [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]] in the east, [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]] in the south east, and [[Yamagata Prefecture|Yamagata]] in the south.

Akita Prefecture is rectangular in shape, roughly 181 km from north to south and 111 km from west to east. The [[Ōu Mountains]] mark the eastern border of the prefecture, and the higher [[Dewa Mountains]] run parallel through the center of the prefecture. Like much of northern Japan, the prefecture has cold winters, particularly away from the sea.

The [[Oga Peninsula]] is a prominent feature of the coastline.
