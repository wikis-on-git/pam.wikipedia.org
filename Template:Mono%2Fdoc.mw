== Usage ==

{{tlx|mono|<var>text to format here</var>}}

renders as:

{{mono|text to format here}}

This template is for formatting short bits of content (the only parameter) as monospaced (nonproportional) text. It is simply a quick shorthand for the necessary [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] code.  It is a replacement for {{tag|tt}}, which is an obsolete element under HTML5. ([http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/obsolete.html#non-conforming-features Non-conforming features])

This template ''should'' be used where the content is being rendered in monospaced text for purely stylistic/display reasons, where this display has no particular semantic significance.

It ''should not'' be used to indicate source code, nor for variables or variable input (use {{tl|code}} or {{tag|code}} for code and {{tl|var}} or {{tag|var}} for variables). For keyboard or samples, use {{tag|kbd}} or {{tag|samp}} respectively.

It ''cannot'' be used to mark up multiple paragraphs, sections or other block elements, as it uses {{tag|span|o}}, which is an inline element. See {{tl|monodiv}} and {{tl|pre}} for a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>-based block version. Or, multiple instances of {{tl|Mono}} can be invoked.

=== Parameters ===
There are two parameters:
;{{para|1}} or unnamed
: The content to format as monospaced. If the content contains a <code>=</code> character, the parameter must be numbered or the template will break. For backward compatibility with an old, merged-in template, this parameter can also be called {{para|2}}.
;{{para|needs_review|yes}}
: Used (e.g. by [[WP:Bot|bots]] or [[WP:AWB|AWB]] scripts) to indicate replacement of now-obsolete {{tag|tt}} markup with {{tnull|mono|...}} markup. This template displays nothing and presently does no categorization, though a cleanup category can be created if necessary. It indicates that the markup may need to be changed to something more semantically meaningful, such as {{tag|code}}, {{tag|samp}}, or {{tag|kbd}}.
