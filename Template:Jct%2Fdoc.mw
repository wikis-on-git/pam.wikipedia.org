<!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE -->
This is the basic syntax you need to get a junction listing for a highway article's exit list or interchange list, just place this in the appropriate place in the exit list table and fill in the variables. Note that this is a complete list of every variable that can be used with <nowiki>{{jct}}</nowiki> and that many are unnecessary in most cases. Variables that are empty can be omitted.  This template currently only supports up to 4 routes per junction list.

{{jct|state=|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8
  |dir1=|dir2=|dir3=|dir4=
  |to1=|to2=|to3=|to4=
  |name1=|name2=|name3=|name4=
  |road=
  |city1=|city2=|city3=|city4=}}
</pre>
For the above parameters here's what you should fill in:
* '''state:''' two-letter abbreviation, state/province that the article route is located in
* '''1, 3, 5, 7:''' the type of route, this parameter replaces the number, i.e. it should not be 1=I, just simply I
::For American routes:
::* '''I''' = Interstate
::* '''BL''' = Business Interstate
::* '''US''' = U.S Route
::**'''US-Bus''' = Business U.S. Route
::**'''US-Alt''' = Alternate U.S. Route
::* State Abbreviation = State Route
::** Texas: '''SL''' = Loop Route, '''SS''' = Spur Route, '''FM''' = Farm to Market Road, '''RM''' = Ranch to Market Road, '''PR''' = Park Road, '''RE''' = Recreational Road, '''Toll''' = Toll routes
::* Some specially-named routes can be called by their abbreviation (ie. '''NJTP''' for [[New Jersey Turnpike]]).<!-- Need a listing -->
::For Canadian routes, the following designations are supported:
::*ON (Ontario) - '''Highway''' (provincial highway, all types), '''RR''' (Regional Road, must supply a ''county'' argument for region)
::*QC (Quebec) - '''Route''' (standard route), '''A''' ([[Autoroute]])
::*NB (New Brunswick) - '''Route''' (''NOTE: Not all routes have shield graphics at present.'')
::*NS (Nova Scotia) - '''Trunk''' (trunk route), '''Hwy''' (highway), '''Route''' (other route)
::*All provinces - '''TCH''' ([[Trans-Canada Highway]])

* '''2, 4, 6, 8:''' the route number for the preceding route type, this parameter replaces the number, i.e. it should not be 2=10, just simply 10
* '''dir1, dir2, dir3, dir4:''' road direction if the exit only leads to a particular direction rather than both, for example Interstate 10 east
* '''to1, to2, to3, to4:''' inputs a To before a route
* '''name1, name2, name3, name4:''' road name if the highway has a common name as well as a route number
* '''road:''' adds road names, separate multiple roads by a forward slash(/).
* '''city1, city2, city3, city4:''' the cities listed on the exit's guide signs, i.e. control cities.  The template will automatically put the city in the following format: <nowiki>[[city1, state|city1]]</nowiki>.  In the event a destination city is located outside of the state the route is in, or the city needs additional disambiguation by area or county, the city portion will need to be placed following this template.
*Other parameters include county1-4, for disambiguating county routes, noshield1-4, for not showing a shield, nolink1-4, for not linking to a minor route that will never have an article, and dab1-4, for disambiguating a route (like [[Minnesota State Highway 62 (east)]] or an Interstate business route; business routes that need separate banners on top are currently supported in the following states: AL, AK, AZ, CA, CO, CT, FL, GA, HI, ID, IN, IL, IA, KS, MD, MS, ND, NE, NV, NM, NC, PA, SC, TN, TX, UT, VA, WA, WI and WY).
