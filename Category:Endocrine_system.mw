The '''endocrine system''' is a control system of ductless [[endocrine gland]]s that secrete [[chemical messenger]]s called [[hormone]]s that circulate within the body via the bloodstream to affect distant organs. It does not include [[exocrine gland]]s such as [[salivary gland]]s, [[sweat gland]]s and glands within the [[gastrointestinal tract]].
