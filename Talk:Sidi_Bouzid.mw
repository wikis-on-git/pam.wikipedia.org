On the Dutch Wikipedia I've created a new article for this city. I am blocked from editing the article on pam.wikipedia, probably because I have just made an account on this version. Can someone please add the interwiki link: [[nl:Sidi Bouzid (stad)]]? Thanks. [[User:Dinsdagskind|Dinsdagskind]] ([[User talk:Dinsdagskind|talk]]) 15:35, 27 Septiembri 2012 (UTC)
