On the Dutch Wikipedia I've created a new article for this city. I am blocked from editing the article on pam.wikipedia, probably because I have just made an account on this version. Can someone please add the interwiki link: [[nl:Sidi Bouzid (stad)]]? Thanks. [[User:Dinsdagskind|Dinsdagskind]] ([[User talk:Dinsdagskind|talk]]) 15:35, 27 Septiembri 2012 (UTC)
:Hi Dinsdagskind, a bot already took care of it (see [//pam.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sidi_Bouzid&diff=232720&oldid=231740 here]). If you create an article, try to find the corresponding article on a big wiki (like the English Wikipedia) and add the interwiki link only there. The interwiki bots will take care of the rest. :) Kind regards, [[User:Mathonius|Mathonius]] ([[User talk:Mathonius|talk]]) 23:38, 27 Septiembri 2012 (UTC)
