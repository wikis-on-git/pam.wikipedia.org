The '''Arab Republic of Egypt''', commonly known as '''Egypt''', (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: مصر, [[Romanization|romanized]] ''Misr'', in [[Egyptian Arabic]] ''Másr'', {{Audio|ar-Gumhuriyat_Misr_al-Arabiyah.ogg|listen}}), is a [[republic]] in [[North Africa]].  While most of the country is geographically located in [[Africa]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] east of the [[Suez Canal]] is in [[Asia]]. 

Covering an area of about 1,020,000 square kilometres (394,000&nbsp;[[square mile|mi²]]), Egypt shares land [[border]]s with [[Libya]] to the west, [[Sudan]] to the south, and [[Israel]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] to the northeast and has coasts on the north and east by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Red Sea]], respectively.  

Egypt is the fifteenth most populous country in the world. The vast majority of its 77 million population (2005) live near the banks of the [[Nile River]] (about 40,000&nbsp;km&sup2;&nbsp;or&nbsp;15,450&nbsp;mi²), where the only arable agricultural land is found. Large areas of land are part of the [[Sahara]] [[Desert]] and are sparsely inhabited. About half of the Egyptian people today are urban, living in the densely populated centers of greater [[Cairo]], the largest city in Africa, and [[Alexandria]].

Egypt is famous for its [[Ancient Egypt|ancient civilization]] and some of the world's most stunning ancient monuments, including the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza Pyramids]], the [[Karnak]] Temple and the [[Valley of the Kings]]; the southern city of [[Luxor]] contains a particularly large number of ancient artifacts. Today, Egypt is widely regarded as the main political and cultural centre of the [[Arab]] and Middle Eastern regions.

==Origin and history of the name==
''Misr'', the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and official name for modern Egypt, is of [[Semitic]] origin directly cognate with the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] מִצְרַיִם ''Mitzráyim'' meaning "the two straits", and possibly means "a country" or "a state." The ancient name for the country, ''kemet'', or "black land," is derived from the fertile black soils deposited by the Nile floods, distinct from the 'red land' (''deshret'') of the desert. This name became ''keme'' in a later stage of [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. The English name "Egypt" came via the Latin word ''Aegyptus'' derived from the ancient Greek word Αίγυπτος ''Aiguptos'' (see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]). This word may in turn be derived from the ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] phrase '' ḥwt-k3-ptḥ'' ("Hwt ka Ptah") meaning "home of the [[Egyptian soul|Ka (part of the soul)]] of Ptah," the name of a temple of the god [[Ptah]] at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. For details see the article ''[[Copt]]''.

==History==
{{Main articles|[[History of Egypt]] and [[Ancient Egypt]]}}

[[Image:sphinx.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], with the Pyramid of Khafre in the background are at the heart of Egypt's thriving tourism industry.]]The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation provided by [[desert]]s to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom was founded circa 3200 [[anno domini|BC]] by King [[Narmer]], and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty, known as the Thirtieth Dynasty, fell to the [[Iran|Persia]]ns in 341 BC who dug the predecessor of the [[Suez canal]] and connected the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. Later, Egypt fell to the Greeks, Romans, [[Byzantines]] and Persians again.

It was the Muslim [[Arabs]] who introduced [[Islam]] and the [[Arabic language]] in the seventh century to the Egyptians, who gradually adopted both. Muslim rulers nominated by the [[Islamic Caliphate]] remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the [[Mamluks]] took control about 1250 and continued to govern even after the conquest of Egypt by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1517.

Following the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub; however, the country also fell heavily into debt. Ostensibly to protect its investments, the [[United Kingdom]] seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued until 1914.

Almost fully independent from the UK in 1922, the Egyptian Parliament drafted and implemented a new [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|constitution]] in 1923 under the leadership of the popular revolutionary [[Saad Zaghlul]]. Between 1924-1936 there existed a short-lived but successful attempt to model Egypt's constitutional government after the European style of government; known as [[Egypt's Liberal Experiment]]. However, in 1952 a military ''[[coup d'état]]'' forced [[King Farouk I]], a constitutional monarch, to abdicate in support of his son [[King Ahmed Fouad II]]. 

Finally, the Egyptian Republic was declared on [[18 June]] [[1953]] with General [[Muhammad Naguib]] as the first President of the Republic. After Naguib was also forced to resign in 1954 by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], the real architect of the 1952 movement, the latter assumed [[Political power|power]] as President and nationalized the [[Suez Canal]] leading to the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]]. Nasser came out of the war an Arab hero, and [[Nasserism]] won widespread influence in the region though was met with mixed reactions amongst Egyptians, many of whom had previously been indifferent to [[Arab nationalism]]. 

Between 1958 and 1961, Nasser undertook to form a union between Egypt and [[Syria]] known as the [[United Arab Republic]]. This attempt too was met with mixed reactions, and it was clear that many Egyptians resented finding that the name of their country, which had endured for thousands of years, was suddenly eliminated. Three years after the 1967 [[Six Day War]], in which Egypt lost the [[Sinai]] to [[Israel]], Nasser died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]], who presented his takeover in terms of a [[The Corrective Revolution|Corrective Revolution]]. Sadat switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the [[Soviet Union]] to the [[United States]], expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform, while violently clamping down on religious and secular opposition alike. Egypt's name was also restored.

In 1973, Egypt, along with [[Syria]], launched a surprise attack on Israel in the [[October War]] (known also as the [[Yom Kippur War]]), which, despite not being a complete military success, was by most accounts a political victory. Both the [[United States]] and the [[USSR]] intervened, and a cease-fire was reached between Egypt and [[Israel]]. In 1979, Sadat made [[Camp David Accords|peace]] with [[Israel]] in exchange for the Sinai, a move that sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt's expulsion from the [[Arab League]] (it was readmitted in 1989). Sadat was murdered by a religious fundamentalist in 1981, and succeeded by [[Hosni Mubarak]].

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Egypt}}

[[Image:presoffice.jpg|thumb|The Office of the [[President of Egypt]] at the [[Presidential Palace]].]]Egypt has been a republic since [[18 June]] [[1953]]. President [[Hosni Mubarak|Mohamed Hosni Mubarak]] has been the [[President of Egypt|President of the Republic]] since [[October 14]] [[1981]], following the assassination of former-President [[Anwar Sadat|Mohammed Anwar El-Sadat]]. Mubarak is currently serving his sixth term in office. He is the leader of the ruling [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]]. [[Heads of government of Egypt|Prime Minister]] Dr. [[Ahmed Nazif]] was sworn in as Prime Minister on [[9 July]] [[2004]], following the resignation of Dr. [[Atef Ebeid]] from his office.

Egypt is regarded by many as being ruled by a military dictatorship. Although power is ostensibly organised under a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[semi-presidential system]], whereby the executive power is theoretically divided between the President and the Prime Minister, in practice it rests almost solely with the President who traditionally has been elected in single-candidate elections for more than fifty years. Egypt also holds regular multi-party parliamentary elections. The last presidential election, in which Mubarak won a sixth consecutive term, was held in September 2005 (see below). 

[[Image:parli.gif|thumb|The [[Parliament of Egypt|Egyptian Parliament]].]]In late-February 2005, Mubarak announced in a surprise television broadcast that he had ordered the reform of the country's presidential election law, paving the way for multi-candidate polls in the upcoming presidential election. For the first time since the 1952 movement, the Egyptian people had an apparent chance to elect a leader from a list of various candidates. The President said his initiative came "out of my full conviction of the need to consolidate efforts for more freedom and democracy." However, the new law placed draconian restrictions on the filing for presidential candidacies, designed to prevent well-known candidates such as [[Ayman Nour]] from standing against Mubarak, and paved the road for his easy re-election victory. 

Concerns were once again expressed after the 2005 elections about government interference in the election process through fraud and vote-rigging. In addition, violence by pro-Mubarak supporters against opposition demonstrators and police brutality were evident during the elections. This poses major questions about the government's purported commitment to democracy.

As a result, most Egyptians are skeptical about the process of democratisation and the role of the elections. A very small proportion of those eligible to vote actually turned out for the 2005 elections. Newspapers, however, have exhibited an increasing degree of freedom in criticizing the president, and the results of the recent parliamentary elections, which saw Islamist parties such as the banned [[Muslim Brotherhood]] winning many seats, genuinely indicate that a change of some sorts is underway.

The permanent headquarters for the [[League of Arab States]] (The Arab League) is located in Cairo. Egypt was the first Arab state to establish diplomatic relations with the state of Israel, after the signing of the [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty]] at the [[Camp David Accords (1978)|Camp David Accords]]. Egypt has a major influence amongst other Arab states, and has historically played an important role as a mediator in resolving disputes between various Arab nations, and in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Most Arab nations still give credence to Egypt playing that role, though its effects are often limited.

==Military==
{{main|Military of Egypt}}

The Egyptian Armed Forces ([[Arabic]]: القوات المسلحة المصرية) consists of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Air Defense. The Coast Guard and Border Guard operate as subordinates to the Navy and Army Command respectively.

[[Image:Egyptian F-16s.jpg|thumb|Egyptian F-16s flying in close formation next to the Pyramids]]The Egyptian military is the strongest military power on the African continent, and the second largest in the Middle East, the largest being that of Israel - (Source: Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies' annual Middle East Strategic Balance). The Egyptian Armed Forces also ranks among the most battle-trained armed forces in the region. Its inventory includes [[F-16]]s, [[Mirage 2000]] aircraft, [[MiG-29]] fighters, [[Apache helicopter]]s, [[M1 Abrams]] Tanks and medium-long range missiles. The Egyptian Armed forces, has a combined troop strength of 450,000 active personnel.

The Supreme Commander is [[Hosni Mubarak]], wartime [[Field Marshal]] of the army, [[admiral]] of the navy, Chief Air Marshal ([[Colonel General]]) of the Air Forces and Air Defence Forces. During peacetime, the title of Supreme Commander is ceremonial.

The Commander-in-Chief and commander of the army is [[Field Marshal]] [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]], Minister Of Defense and Military Production.

The Chief of Staff is Lt. Gen. Sami Hafez Enan.

The Commander of the Navy is Vice Admiral Tamer Abd El Aleem Mohamed Ismail

The Commander of the Air Forces is Air Marshal (Lt. Gen.) Magdy Galal Sharawi 

The Commander of the Air Defence Forces is Major General Abd El Aziz Seif

[[Conscription#Egypt|Conscription]] is compulsory for Egyptian men of 18 years of age. Full-time students may defer their service until the age of 28. The length of the service depends on the level of education achieved by the conscripted.

Military relations between Egypt and the US are strong. Military cooperation between the two countries covers a number of strategic areas, including cooperation in the ongoing process of modernising Egyptian armaments and training the Egyptian armed forces.

While military cooperation between the US and Egypt is close and diversified, this does not constitute a form of military alliance. Nothing could furnish clearer proof of this than the high degree of transparency surrounding all aspects of Egyptian-US military cooperation. Bilateral exercises and mutual training are carried out regularly, and, according to one US source, reflect the high level of professionalism and the growing excellence of the fighting men and women in the various branches of the Egyptian armed forces.

Egypt takes part regularly in military exercises with the US and other European and Arab allies, including the manoeuvres that take place in Egypt every two years.

Egypt continues to contribute regularly to United Nations peacekeeping missions, most recently in [[East Timor]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Liberia]].

==Governorates==
{{main|Governorates of Egypt}}
[[Image:Eg-map.png|thumb|right|Map of Egypt]]

Egypt is divided into 26 [[governorate]]s (''Muhafazat;'' singular &ndash; ''Muhafazah'') and the city of [[Al Uqsur]] (Luxor), which is classified as a city rather than a governorate.

==Foreign relations==
{{main|Foreign relations of Egypt}}
[[Image:modern_cairo2.jpg|thumb|right|Modern Cairo]]Geography, population, history, military strength, and diplomatic expertise give Egypt extensive political influence in the Middle East. Cairo has been a crossroads of Arab commerce and culture for millennia, and its intellectual and Islamic institutions are at the center of the region's social and cultural development.

The [[League of Arab States]] headquarters is in Cairo. The Secretary General of the League has traditionally been an Egyptian. Former Egyptian Foreign Minister [[Amr Moussa]] is the present Secretary General of the Arab League.

Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister Boutros Boutros-Ghali served as Secretary General of the United Nations from 1991 to 1996.

Egypt is on good terms with all of its neighbours, and was the first Arab nation to make peace with Israel. It has a territorial dispute with Sudan over the [[Hala'ib Triangle]].

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Egypt}}

[[Image:Egypt south of Cairo.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Egyptian countryside, south of Cairo.]]Egypt's economy depends mainly on agriculture, media, petroleum exports, and tourism; there are also more than 5 million Egyptians working abroad, mainly in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf area like [[UAE]], and [[Europe]]. The [[United States]] as well has a large population of Egyptian immigrants.

The completion of the [[Aswan High Dam]] in 1971 and the resultant [[Lake Nasser]] have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the [[agriculture]] and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly-growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy.

The government has struggled to prepare the economy for the new millennium through economic reform and massive investments in communications and physical infrastructure, much financed from U.S. [[foreign aid]] (since 1979, an average of 2.2 billion dollars per year). Egypt is the third-largest recipient of such funds from the United States following the Iraq war. Economic conditions are starting to improve considerably after a period of stagnation due to the adoption of more liberal economic policies by the government, as well as increased revenues from tourism and a booming stock market. In its annual report, the [[IMF]] has rated Egypt as one of the top countries in the world undertaking economic reforms.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Egypt}}

Egypt is the second most populous country in [[Africa]], at about 77,500,000 people. Nearly all the population is concentrated along the banks of the [[River Nile|Nile]], notably [[Alexandria]] and [[Cairo]], and in the Delta and near the [[Suez Canal]]. Approximately 90% of the population adheres to [[Islam]] and most of the remainder to [[Christianity]] (primarily the [[Coptic Christian|Coptic Orthodox]] denomination).

The Egyptians are a fairly homogeneous people. [[North African]] and Eastern [[Mediterranean]] influences are more predominant in the north, while the south which bears the same influences is also home to people who are related to [[Nubians]] and Africans further southeast such as Ethiopians. The bulk of modern Egyptian society still maintains a homogenous genetic tie to ancient Egyptian society, which has always been rural and quite populous compared to neighboring countries. The Egyptian people have spoken only languages from the Afro-Asiatic family (previously known as Hamito-Semitic) throughout their history starting with Old Egyptian to modern [[Egyptian Arabic]].

Ethnic minorities include a small number of Bedouin Arab nomads in the Sinai and eastern and western deserts, as well as some Nubians clustered along the Nile in Upper (southern) Egypt who are estimated to be about 0.8% of the population. Egypt also hosts some 90,000 refugees and asylum seekers, made up mostly of 70,000 Palestinian refugees and 20,000 Sudanese refugees. The once-vibrant Jewish community in Egypt has virtually [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|disappeared]], with only a small number remaining in Egypt and those who visit on religious occasions. Several important Jewish archeological and historical sites also remain.

==Religion==
{{main|Religion in Egypt}}
[[Image:monastry3.jpg|thumb|right|Over six million Egyptians follow the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith as members of the [[Coptic Church]]]]

According to the constitution, any new legislation must implicitly agree with Islamic (Arabic: الإسلام) laws. Egypt is predominantly Muslim, covering about 94% of the population, most belong to the Sunni branch of Islam. Christians represent about 6% of the population, primarily the [[Coptic Christian|Coptic]] denomination, though other Christian groups are present, including standard [[Roman Catholics]], [[Greek Orthodox]], and [[Armenian Orthodox]], in [[Alexandria]] and [[Cairo]], whose adherents are mainly descendants of [[Italy|Italian]], [[Greece|Greek]], and [[Armenians|Armenian]] immigrants. <BR>
There are also some few, small Jewish communities that are numbered as few as 300 Egyptians.<BR>
<BR>
There are also many who consider themselves as atheists, agnostics, and skeptics, although their numbers can not be identified.<BR>
<BR>
The mainstream [[Hanafi]] school of [[Sunni]] Islam is largely organised by the state, through ''Wizaret Al-Awkaf'' (Ministry of Religious Affairs). ''Al-Awkaf'' controls all mosques and Muslim clerics. [[Imams]] are trained in Imam vocational schools and at [[Al-Azhar University]]. The department supports Sunni Islam and has commissions authorised to give ''Fatwa'' judgements on Islamic issues. <BR>
<BR>
Egypt also hosts two major religious institutions. [[Al-Azhar University]] is the oldest Islamic institution for higher studies (founded around 970 CE), with its corresponding mosque [[Al-Azhar]].  Egypt also has a strong Christian heritage as it is the home of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] headed by the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], which has a following of approximately 50 million Christians worldwide.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Egypt}}

[[Image:EgyptianDesert.JPG|thumb|right|A great part of Egypt's landmass is desert.]]

Egypt is bordered by [[Libya]] on the west, [[Sudan]] on the south, and on [[Israel]] on the northeast.  Egypt's important role in geopolitics stems from its strategic position: a [[transcontinental nation]], it possesses a land bridge (the Isthmus of Suez) between [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], which in turn is traversed by a navigable waterway (the [[Suez Canal]]) that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the [[Indian Ocean]] via the [[Red Sea]].

Towns and cities include [[Alexandria]], one of the great ancient cities, [[Aswan]], [[Asyut]], [[Cairo]], the modern Egyptian capital, [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]], [[Giza]], the site of the Pyramid of Khufu, [[Hurghada]], [[Luxor]], [[Kom Ombo]], [[Port Safaga]], [[Port Said]], [[Sharm el Sheikh]], Shubra-El-Khema, [[Suez]], where the Suez Canal is located, [[Zagazig]], and [[Al-Minya]].

Deserts: Egypt includes parts of the [[Sahara Desert]] and of the [[Libyan Desert]]. These deserts were referred to as the "red land" in ancient Egypt, and they protected the Kingdom of the Pharaohs from harm.

[[oasis|Oases]] include: [[Bahariya Oasis]], Dakhleh Oasis, Farafra Oasis, [[Kharga Oasis]], [[Siwa Oasis]]. An oasis is a fertile or green area in the midst of a desert.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Egypt}}

[[Image:Cairo.jpg|thumb|left|Egypt's capital [[Cairo]] is the largest city in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]]]Egypt's capital city, Cairo, is Africa's largest city and has been renowned for centuries as a center of learning, culture and commerce. The Egyptian [[Academy of the Arabic Language]] is responsible for regulating the [[Arabic Language]] (Arabic:اللغة العربية ) throughout the world.

Egypt also hosts two major religious institutions. [[Al-Azhar University]] (Arabic: جامعة الأزهر ) is the oldest [[Islam|Islamic]] institution for higher studies (founded around 970 CE), with its corresponding mosque Al-Azhar. The head of Al-Azhar is traditionally regarded as the supreme leader of Sunni Muslims all over the world. Egypt also has a strong Christian heritage as evidenced by the existence of the [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic Orthodox Church]] headed by the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], which has a following of approximately 50 million Christians worldwide (one of the famous Coptic Orthodox Churches is Saint Takla Haimanot Church in Alexandria http://www.St-Takla.org).

Though considered a low-income country, Egypt has a thriving media and arts industry, with more than 30 satellite channels and more than 100 motion pictures produced each year. To bolster its media industry, especially with the keen competition from the [[Persian Gulf states]] and Lebanon, it has built a large media city that it has promoted as the "Hollywood of the East." Egypt is the only Arab country with an [[opera]] house.

Some famous Egyptians include:

*[[Saad Zaghlul]] (leader of first modern Egyptian revolution)
*[[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] (former president)
*[[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] (former Secretary General of the United Nations)
*[[Naguib Mahfouz]] (Nobel Prize-winning novelist)
*[[Umm Kulthum]] (singer)
*[[Omar Sharif]] (actor)
*[[Ahmed H. Zewail|Ahmed Zewail]] (Nobel Prize-winning chemist)
*[[Mohamed ElBaradei]] (Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and Winner of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize)
