The '''Arab Republic of Egypt''', commonly known as '''Egypt''', (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: مصر, [[Romanization|romanized]] ''Misr'', in [[Egyptian Arabic]] ''Másr'', {{Audio|ar-Gumhuriyat_Misr_al-Arabiyah.ogg|listen}}), is a [[republic]] in [[North Africa]].  While most of the country is geographically located in [[Africa]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] east of the [[Suez Canal]] is in [[Asia]]. 

Covering an area of about 1,020,000 square kilometres (394,000&nbsp;[[square mile|mi²]]), Egypt shares land [[border]]s with [[Libya]] to the west, [[Sudan]] to the south, and [[Israel]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] to the northeast and has coasts on the north and east by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Red Sea]], respectively.  

Egypt is the fifteenth most populous country in the world. The vast majority of its 77 million population (2005) live near the banks of the [[Nile River]] (about 40,000&nbsp;km&sup2;&nbsp;or&nbsp;15,450&nbsp;mi²), where the only arable agricultural land is found. Large areas of land are part of the [[Sahara]] [[Desert]] and are sparsely inhabited. About half of the Egyptian people today are urban, living in the densely populated centers of greater [[Cairo]], the largest city in Africa, and [[Alexandria]].

Egypt is famous for its [[Ancient Egypt|ancient civilization]] and some of the world's most stunning ancient monuments, including the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza Pyramids]], the [[Karnak]] Temple and the [[Valley of the Kings]]; the southern city of [[Luxor]] contains a particularly large number of ancient artifacts. Today, Egypt is widely regarded as the main political and cultural centre of the [[Arab]] and Middle Eastern regions.

==Origin and history of the name==
''Misr'', the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and official name for modern Egypt, is of [[Semitic]] origin directly cognate with the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] מִצְרַיִם ''Mitzráyim'' meaning "the two straits", and possibly means "a country" or "a state." The ancient name for the country, ''kemet'', or "black land," is derived from the fertile black soils deposited by the Nile floods, distinct from the 'red land' (''deshret'') of the desert. This name became ''keme'' in a later stage of [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. The English name "Egypt" came via the Latin word ''Aegyptus'' derived from the ancient Greek word Αίγυπτος ''Aiguptos'' (see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]). This word may in turn be derived from the ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] phrase '' ḥwt-k3-ptḥ'' ("Hwt ka Ptah") meaning "home of the [[Egyptian soul|Ka (part of the soul)]] of Ptah," the name of a temple of the god [[Ptah]] at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. For details see the article ''[[Copt]]''.

==History==
{{Main articles|[[History of Egypt]] and [[Ancient Egypt]]}}

[[Image:sphinx.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], with the Pyramid of Khafre in the background are at the heart of Egypt's thriving tourism industry.]]The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation provided by [[desert]]s to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom was founded circa 3200 [[anno domini|BC]] by King [[Narmer]], and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty, known as the Thirtieth Dynasty, fell to the [[Iran|Persia]]ns in 341 BC who dug the predecessor of the [[Suez canal]] and connected the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. Later, Egypt fell to the Greeks, Romans, [[Byzantines]] and Persians again.

It was the Muslim [[Arabs]] who introduced [[Islam]] and the [[Arabic language]] in the seventh century to the Egyptians, who gradually adopted both. Muslim rulers nominated by the [[Islamic Caliphate]] remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the [[Mamluks]] took control about 1250 and continued to govern even after the conquest of Egypt by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1517.

Following the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub; however, the country also fell heavily into debt. Ostensibly to protect its investments, the [[United Kingdom]] seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued until 1914.

Almost fully independent from the UK in 1922, the Egyptian Parliament drafted and implemented a new [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|constitution]] in 1923 under the leadership of the popular revolutionary [[Saad Zaghlul]]. Between 1924-1936 there existed a short-lived but successful attempt to model Egypt's constitutional government after the European style of government; known as [[Egypt's Liberal Experiment]]. However, in 1952 a military ''[[coup d'état]]'' forced [[King Farouk I]], a constitutional monarch, to abdicate in support of his son [[King Ahmed Fouad II]]. 

Finally, the Egyptian Republic was declared on [[18 June]] [[1953]] with General [[Muhammad Naguib]] as the first President of the Republic. After Naguib was also forced to resign in 1954 by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], the real architect of the 1952 movement, the latter assumed [[Political power|power]] as President and nationalized the [[Suez Canal]] leading to the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]]. Nasser came out of the war an Arab hero, and [[Nasserism]] won widespread influence in the region though was met with mixed reactions amongst Egyptians, many of whom had previously been indifferent to [[Arab nationalism]]. 

Between 1958 and 1961, Nasser undertook to form a union between Egypt and [[Syria]] known as the [[United Arab Republic]]. This attempt too was met with mixed reactions, and it was clear that many Egyptians resented finding that the name of their country, which had endured for thousands of years, was suddenly eliminated. Three years after the 1967 [[Six Day War]], in which Egypt lost the [[Sinai]] to [[Israel]], Nasser died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]], who presented his takeover in terms of a [[The Corrective Revolution|Corrective Revolution]]. Sadat switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the [[Soviet Union]] to the [[United States]], expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform, while violently clamping down on religious and secular opposition alike. Egypt's name was also restored.

In 1973, Egypt, along with [[Syria]], launched a surprise attack on Israel in the [[October War]] (known also as the [[Yom Kippur War]]), which, despite not being a complete military success, was by most accounts a political victory. Both the [[United States]] and the [[USSR]] intervened, and a cease-fire was reached between Egypt and [[Israel]]. In 1979, Sadat made [[Camp David Accords|peace]] with [[Israel]] in exchange for the Sinai, a move that sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt's expulsion from the [[Arab League]] (it was readmitted in 1989). Sadat was murdered by a religious fundamentalist in 1981, and succeeded by [[Hosni Mubarak]].

Egypt is divided into 26 [[governorate]]s (''Muhafazat;'' singular &ndash; ''Muhafazah'') and the city of [[Al Uqsur]] (Luxor), which is classified as a city rather than a governorate.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Egypt}}

[[Image:EgyptianDesert.JPG|thumb|right|A great part of Egypt's landmass is desert.]]

Egypt is bordered by [[Libya]] on the west, [[Sudan]] on the south, and on [[Israel]] on the northeast.  Egypt's important role in geopolitics stems from its strategic position: a [[transcontinental nation]], it possesses a land bridge (the Isthmus of Suez) between [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], which in turn is traversed by a navigable waterway (the [[Suez Canal]]) that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the [[Indian Ocean]] via the [[Red Sea]].

Towns and cities include [[Alexandria]], one of the great ancient cities, [[Aswan]], [[Asyut]], [[Cairo]], the modern Egyptian capital, [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]], [[Giza]], the site of the Pyramid of Khufu, [[Hurghada]], [[Luxor]], [[Kom Ombo]], [[Port Safaga]], [[Port Said]], [[Sharm el Sheikh]], Shubra-El-Khema, [[Suez]], where the Suez Canal is located, [[Zagazig]], and [[Al-Minya]].

Deserts: Egypt includes parts of the [[Sahara Desert]] and of the [[Libyan Desert]]. These deserts were referred to as the "red land" in ancient Egypt, and they protected the Kingdom of the Pharaohs from harm.

[[oasis|Oases]] include: [[Bahariya Oasis]], Dakhleh Oasis, Farafra Oasis, [[Kharga Oasis]], [[Siwa Oasis]]. An oasis is a fertile or green area in the midst of a desert.
