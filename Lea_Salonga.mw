'''Lea Salonga-Chien''' (born '''Maria Lea Carmen Imutan Salonga''' on [[February 22]], [[1971]] in [[Angeles City]] in Pampanga) is a [[Tony Awards|Tony Award]]-winning [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[singer]] and [[actor|actress]] who is best known for  her portrayal of Kim in the [[musical]] ''[[Miss Saigon]]''.    In the field of [[musical theater]], no other Filipino has achieved the same international recognition as Salonga. She has been the first to win various international awards for a single role. 

She was the first [[Asian]] to play [[Eponine]] in the musical ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' on [[Broadway]], and is slated to star as Fantine starting [[March 6]], [[2007]]. On [[February 11]], [[2007]], she is performing at the [[Philippine International Convention Center]] with the [[Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra]]. 

Lea recently released her first studio album in 7 years called "Inspired".  The carrier single is a                       remake of Beverly Craven's "Promise Me".

==Early life==
Lea Salonga was born to Feliciano Genuino Salonga and Ligaya Alcantara Imutan. She spent the first six years of her childhood in [[Angeles City]], Pampanga, before moving to [[Manila]].

Salonga became a successful child star in the Philippines.  At the age of seven, she made her professional debut performing in the musical ''[[The King and I]]'' by [[Repertory Philippines]]. She became the lead star of ''[[Annie]]'' and joined other productions, such as: ''[[Cat On A Hot Tin Roof]]'', ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[The Rose Tattoo]]'', ''[[The Sound Of Music]]'', ''[[The Goodbye Girl]]'', ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'' and ''[[The Fantasticks]]''.

She began her recording career at the age of ten with her first album, ''[[Small Voice]]'', which received a Gold certification. Her younger brother [[Gerard Salonga]] performed a duet with her with the song, ''Happiness''. Since then he has collaborated with her many times as Musical Director or Creative Director.

As a child star, she has also hosted her own musical television show, ''Love, Lea,'' and opened for [[Stevie Wonder]] during his 1998 concert in Manila. She won three ''Aliw Awards'' for ''Best Child Performer'' from 1981 to 1983. In 1983, her sophomore album, "Lea" was released. She was also starred in [[German Moreno]]'s teen variety show ''[[That's Entertainment]]''.  The young Lea also appeared with [[Herbert Bautista]] in several popular family-oriented Filipino films in the late 1980s such as ''Ninja Kids'', ''Captain Barbell'' and ''Pik Pak Boom''.

==International career==
Salonga's big breakthrough came when she was selected to play Kim in the musical ''Miss Saigon'' in [[1989]].  After not finding a strong enough Asiatic actress/singer in the [[United Kingdom]], the producers scoured many Asian countries looking for the lead role of this major British production.  For her audition, Salonga chose to sing [[Alain Boublil|Boublil]] and [[Claude-Michel Schönberg|Schönberg]]'s "[[On My Own (Les Mis)| On My Own]]" from "Les Miserables," and was later asked to sing "Sun and Moon" to test her voice quality's compatibility with the songs in the musical. The members of the panel were "bowled over" by Salonga's rendition of the songs. After auditioning Salonga and [[Monique Wilson]] with songs from the musical, Salonga was offered the lead role and Wilson the alternate lead, as well as a regular minor role.

For her performance as Kim, Salonga won the ''[[Laurence Olivier Awards|Olivier]] for Best Performance by an Actress in a Musical'' for the 1989/1990 season. From its original [[London]] home, ''Miss Saigon'' moved to Broadway in [[April 1991]]. Salonga subsequently garnered the [[Tony Award|Tony]], [[Drama Desk]], and [[Outer Critics Circle Award]]s for the same role.

In 1993, Salonga played the role of street waif Eponine in the Broadway production of ''Les Misérables'', then flew to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] to perform the song "A Whole New World" (of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Aladdin (movie)|Aladdin]]'') at the 65th Annual [[Academy Awards]], where the song won an Oscar. (Salonga sang the song in the movie as the singing voice of Princess Jasmine.) In the same year she released her self-titled international debut album with [[Atlantic Records]], which sold slowly in the USA but went platinum in the Philippines and sold 3 million copies worldwide.[http://www.leasalonga.net/bio]

In 1995 Salonga performed as Geri Riordan, an 18-year old adopted [[Vietnamese-American]] child in the movie ''[[Redwood Curtain]]'', which starred [[John Lithgow]] and [[Jeff Daniels]]. 

Salonga was invited by Sir [[Cameron Mackintosh]] to play the role of Eponine for the 10th Anniversary concert of ''Les Miserables'' at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Salonga performed as part of a "dream cast" composed of [[Colm Wilkinson]], [[Michael_Ball_%28singer%29|Michael Ball]], [[Judy Kuhn]], and [[Philip Quast]].

Salonga then acted in various musical theater productions around the Philippines and [[Singapore]]. She notably starred as Sandy in ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', Sonia Walsk in ''[[They're Playing Our Song]]'', The Witch in ''[[Into The Woods]]'', and Lizzie in ''[[Baby]]''. In 1997, "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing" (recordings from her childhood days) was released to gold sales in the Philippines. It was followed up by "Lea... In Love" in 1998. "By Heart" followed two years later, both albums reaching multiple platinum status in the Philippines. [http://www.leasalonga.net/bio]

In 2001,  Salonga had a grand homecoming via the Manila production of ''Miss Saigon'' staged at the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]].  That same year  and again in [[2003]], Salonga recreated the role of [[Lien Hughes]] on the [[soap opera]] ''[[As the World Turns]]'', which was originally played by [[Ming-Na Wen]] years before.  She also made a guest appearance in the medical drama [[E.R.]], playing the role of a patient with [[Lymphoma]].

In [[2002]] Salonga returned to broadway to play the role of a Chinese immigrant in a reinterpretation of [[Rogers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' opposite [[Jose Llana]].   The show was given a brand new [[libretto]] which presented Asian Americans with more dignity than the original but it also played with the stereotypes.  It was considered one of the 10 best plays on Broadway in 2002 by ''[[Time Magazine]]'' [http://www.time.com/time/bestandworst/2002/theater.html].  The musical, which had a short run on Broadway, later on garnered nominations for Best Book, Best Costume Designer, and Best Choreographer.  However, Ms. Salonga's performance, which received mixed reviews, was not nominated at the Tony Award.   

In [[February 2005|February]] and [[March 2005]], Salonga played her first US concert tour in [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Atlantic City]], and [[Chicago]]. Dates in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Norfolk, Virginia]] followed in [[July 2005]].  On [[November 7]], [[2005]], Salonga performed with a 26-piece ensemble to a sold out crowd of 2,804 at the Isaac Stern Hall in [[Carnegie Hall]] for the benefit of Diverse City Theater Company. Salonga is only the third Filipino solo artist to perform at the venue (the first was [[Regine Velasquez]] followed by [[Jose Mari Chan]]).

Salonga's Disney film credits include the singing voice of  [[Princess Jasmine]] for ''[[Aladdin (movie)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), and [[Fa Mulan]] for ''[[Mulan]]'' (1998), as well as the voice of Mrs. Kusakabe (Satsuki and Mei's mother) in Disney's 2005 English dub of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''.

Salonga performed three times for American Presidents (she was invited twice to the [[White House]] and again performed for [[President Bush]]'s state visit to the Philippines) and once for Her Majesty, [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

In the [[Doha 2006]] the 15th [[Asian Games]] held in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] on [[December 15]], [[2006]], the closing ceremony concluded with a song "Triumph of the One" sung by Salonga in front of thousands. 

On [[January 3]], [[2007]] it was announced that Salonga will return to Broadway in the musical ''Les Miserables'' replacing [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] as [[Fantine]]. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/104603.html]

==Personal life==
On [[January 10]], [[2004]], Salonga married Robert Charles Chien, a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]]-[[Japan]]ese [[managing director]] of an entertainment [[software]] company in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Their first daughter, Nicole Beverly, was born on [[May 16]], [[2006]].  She was named after Lea Salonga's late [[mother-in-law]], Beverly Chien.
