THE POET

'''He was born with eyes wide-open,
That he may see the beauty in everything,
He jots what he sees with the might of his pen,
With a soul praising each morning.

He’s blest with a mind great and full,
To turn life’s darkness into halo gold,
His endless dream of quiet and peaceful,
Lives in fair youth and days grown old.

His heart is warmer and sweeter,
With deep emotions from birth,
He’s got the hands of a painter,
To put colors to Heaven and Earth…

His skin, so sensitive to Nature’s touch
What he feels, he’s apt to impart,
He touches the morning ‘til twilight hush,
And feels his way into everyone’s heart.

He has the tongue that speaks loud and strong,
Of mighty words, mightier that swords,
He digs the right to correct the wrong,
Makes beautiful ends with rhyming words.

He has the memory treasuring the past,
The souvenirs kept that he treasures much,
And brings back to life, the young life that was,
To add life to the present with glorious touch.

His conscience is as clear as his mind,
He smiles at the rain that falls,
He makes the pale sun to shine,
And lay bridges and builds no walls.

The hidden stars he let go to sparkle,
The crescent moon shall then become full,
Dew drops from Heaven softly sprinkle,
Like blessings to turn the night wonderful.

He’s got a strong faith in God above,
With burning breath, no quivering fear,
In his heart lies a lovely genuine love,
That holds him strong all through his years.

If in the morning, beneath a lovelier sky,
His breathing rested, his eyes don’t open,
Shed no tear for he just passed by,
To tell us, he had walked tall among men.

His name shines in every portal,
He leaves us with so much to remember,
Shed no tear THE POET is immortal,
His shining life died out to live forever…

Mibayit yang macamulat queang mata,
Para aquit ing sintingan ning gana-gana,
Picudta na ing acaquit gamit ing pluma,
Pupuri qng abacan ing queang caladua.

Micalaman yang pamiisip asnang capnu,
Para ing dulum arenan nang asque guintu,
Ing taguimpan nang matajimic a yatu,
Mabie qng kayanacan na’t quetuang pamitau.

Pusu nang mapali-pali quing yubu’t yumu,
Malalam panamdam manibat meging yang tau,
Icua na pangamat pati pintor a talasuyu,
Para mamie cule quing Banua at yatu.

Balat nang sensitibu qng Naturalesang paligid,
Nanuman panamdam asasabi nang matulid,
Abac angga nang silim, maneneng titingid,
At aramdam ding balang pusung manalig.

Ing dilang masicanan iagcas siualang malacas,
Amanung igit timbang quing sundang pecatalas,
Ipasiag na ing ustu, ing mali austung lacuas,
Apanayun ing sepu caring amanung de rimas.

Pibalic-balic na pa panaun meco’t linabas,
Recuerdong masinup, pacamalang uagas,
Para abiayan pasibayu, tang bie macayanac,
Macabie qng ngeni tune gloriang galac.

Queang consiensyang sing lino ning isip,
Quing balag ning uran, macatiman magmasid,
Pati aldong emaslag apasala nang anggang binit,
Maglatag yang tete at emanalacarang dalig.

Ding macapanpan a batuin, apaslagan na la,
Ing bulan a mala-sucle mibilugan ya pa,
Ing ambun mananabung ibat banua,
Gauan nang calam qng benging payapa.

Matatag ya tiuala qng Dios Ibpang matas,
Mapali nang inaua, alang canglap pamalas,
Qng pusu na magluyun lugud alang dit’man pecas,
Macabie sicanan quea caring banuang lalabas.

Cayabacan, quing silung ning malagung banua,
Nung inaua mabugtu’t mata enamibuclat pa,
Migpaindalan yamu, inya eta sucat maglua,
Papasiag na quecatamu, dinalan yang tiba-tiba.

Lagyu na maslag caring pasbul entrada,
At lacuanan nacatamu dacal a alala,
ING POETA mabie ya pangcabang-caba,
Mete ya bie para cumabie alang-angga….
