The '''Federal Republic of Germany''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'', {{Audio|De-Bundesrepublik_Deutschland-pronunciation.ogg|<small>listen</small>}}) is one of [[G8|the world's leading]] [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] countries. Located in [[Central Europe]], it is bordered to the north by the [[North Sea]], [[Denmark]], and the [[Baltic Sea]], to the east by [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]], to the south by [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], and to the west by [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]].

Germany is a [[Constitutional democracy|democratic]] parliamentary [[Federation|federal]] republic, made up of 16 [[States of Germany|states]] called Länder, which in certain spheres act independently of the federation. Historically consisting of several sovereign nations with their own history, culture as well as religion, Germany was [[German unification|unified]] as a [[Nation-state|nation state]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in [[1870]]/[[1871]]. 

The Federal Republic of Germany is a member state of the [[United Nations]], [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]], the [[G8]] and the [[G4 nations]], and is a founding member of the [[European Union]]. It is the European Union's most populous and most economically powerful member state. Germany also plays a role as one of the world's [[major power]]s.
==History==
{{main|History of Germany}}

The state now known as Germany was unified as a modern nation-state only in 1871, when the [[German Empire]], dominated by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], was forged. This began the German ''[[Reich]]'', usually translated as "empire", but also meaning "kingdom", "domain" or "realm."

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Germany}}

[[Image:Germany demography.png|thumb|right|300px|Population of Germany over time. The federal statistics office estimates the population will shrink to approximately 75 million by 2050 [http://www.destatis.de/presse/englisch/pm2003/p2300022.htm]]]
Due to the country's federal and decentralized structure Germany has a number of larger cities. The most populous cities of Germany are [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Dortmund]]. By far the largest conurbation is the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] region, including the Düsseldorf-Cologne district and the cities of [[Essen]], [[Dortmund]], [[Duisburg]] and [[Bochum]]. The federal structure has kept the population oriented towards a number of large cities, and has precluded the growth of any single city that would rival such European capitals as [[London]], [[Paris]] or [[Moscow]] for size.

As of 2004, about 7.5 million foreign citizen residents were living in Germany. The majority came from [[Turkey]], followed by [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Albania]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]], [[Spain]], [[Austria]], [[Portugal]], [[Vietnam]], [[Morocco]], [[Poland]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Lebanon]] and [[France]]. [http://www.destatis.de/basis/e/bevoe/bevoetab10.htm] Thanks to reform of [[German nationality law]], many of these immigrants are eligible for [[naturalisation]] ([http://www.destatis.de/basis/e/bevoe/bevoetab8.htm]).
9% of the population is not ethnically German.{{fact}}

Germany is still a primary destination for political and economic [[refugee]]s from many [[developing country|less industrialized countries]], especially [[Turkey]] and [[southern Europe|Southern]]/[[Balkans|Southeastern]] [[Europe]], but the number of annual asylum seekers has been declining in recent years, reaching about 50,000+ in 2003.

An [[Danish people|ethnic Danish]] minority of about 50,000 people lives in [[Schleswig]], most of them close to the Danish border, in the north; a small number of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] people known as the [[Sorbs]] lives in the states of [[Saxony]] (about 40,000) and [[Brandenburg]] (about 20,000). The [[Frisian language]] is [[First language|mother tongue]] to about 12,000 speakers in Germany. In rural areas of Northern Germany, [[Low German]] is widely spoken. The [[North Rhine-Westphalia|North-Rhine Westphalian]] border is a transitional area between German and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

There are also a large number of [[ethnic German]] immigrants from the former [[Soviet Union]] area (1.7 million), [[Poland]] (0.7 million) and [[Romania]] (0.3 million) (1980–1999 totals), who are automatically granted German citizenship, and thus do not show up in foreign resident statistics; unlike non-ethnic German immigrants, they have been settled by the government almost evenly spread throughout Germany.

In 2000, the German [[SPD]]-led government along with Bündnis 90/Die Grünen ([[Alliance '90/The Greens]]), officially announced its intention to [[Nuclear power phase-out|phase out the use of nuclear energy]]. [[Jürgen Trittin]] as the Minister of Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, reached an agreement with energy companies on the gradual shut down of [[List of nuclear reactors#Germany|the country's nineteen nuclear power plants]] and a cessation of civil usage of [[nuclear power]] by 2020.

In 1999, electricity production in Germany was powered by [[coal]] (47%), [[nuclear power]] (30%), [[natural gas]] (14%), [[renewable energy|renewable sources]] (including [[hydroelectricity|hydro]], wind and [[solar power]]) (6%), and [[petrol|oil]] (2%) ([http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/germany.html]). As for energy consumption, oil accounted for 41% of the total. At the [[World Climate Conference|World climate conference]], the German government announced a [[carbon dioxide]] reduction target of 25% by the year 2005 as compared to 1990, to [[Greenhouse effect|protect global climate]]. ([http://www.agores.org/Publications/EnR/GermanyREPolicy2000.pdf], pdf).

In 2005, the German government reached a controversial agreement with [[Russia]] in building a gas pipeline at the bottom of the Baltic Sea directly from Russia to Germany.

===Social issues===
{{main|Social issues in Germany}}

The German social market economy ([[German language|German]]: ''soziale Marktwirtschaft'') helped bring about the "economic miracle" (the German "''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''") that rebuilt Germany from ashes after World War II to one of the most impressive economies in Europe. Still today, [[Ludwig Erhard]], minister of economics in the [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] administration ([[1949]]-[[1963]]) and later federal chancellor ([[1963]]-[[1966]]), is widely recognized as having been the "father" of this profound rise in the country's economic and social wealth.

Germany continues to struggle with a number of social issues although problems created by the [[German reunification|German Reunification]] of 1990 have begun to diminish. The standard of living is higher in the western half of the country, but easterners now share a reasonably high standard of living. Germans continue to be concerned about a relatively high level of unemployment. Germany has passed several reforms to curb unemployment. Some of these reforms will require people in the labour force to work harder and more efficiently. This will enable employers to reduce the number of their employees further.

For centuries, a woman's role in German society was summed up by the three words: Kinder (children), Kirche (church), and Küche (kitchen). Throughout the twentieth century, however, women have gradually won victories in their quest for equal rights. Despite significant gains, discrimination remains in united Germany. Women are noticeably absent in the top tiers of German business. They only hold 9.2% of jobs in Germany's upper and middle management positions, according to 2002 figures from the Hoppenstedt business databank. Since 2001 women are in active duty in the Bundeswehr.

Since World War II, Germany has experienced intermittent turmoil from various extremist groups. In the 1970s the terrorist [[Red Army Faction]] engaged in a string of assassinations and kidnappings against political and business figures and there has been a recent surge in right-wing extremist crimes. According to former Interior Minister [[Otto Schily]], the number of these crimes rose 8.4% to 12,553 cases in 2004, which the minister attributed to such crimes as the display of illegal [[Nazism|Nazi]] symbols being reported more frequently.{{fact}} The majority of these cases are not violent crimes, although these do exist as well.

Germany is also burdened with an extremely low fertility/birthrate. Obviously, this has and will continue to cause many economic and social problems. For instance, the low birthrate may cause a shortage of young workers to replace the aging ones in the future. This is expected to cause trouble in Germany's generous social welfare system, due to fewer taxpayers and more elderly who will receive benefits. There is much debate as to what should be done to curb this trend. More daycare centers, paying cash to mothers for babies that are born, and incentives for men or women to stay home with the children have all been offered as solutions to this problem. So far none have been fully implemented.

Germany has failed to implement EU laws prohibiting racial discrimination. The European Court of Justice ruled on [[April 29]] [[2005]], that Germany had breached EU law by failing to transpose fully the 'Racial Equality Directive' prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin (Directive 2000/43/EC). The deadline for EU Member States to transpose this Directive was [[July 19]] [[2003]] – except for the 10 new Member States, who had to ensure that their legislation complied with the Directives by their accession to the EU on [[May 1]] [[2004]]. Immigrants to Germany may generally face integration issues and other difficulties. In addition to the challenges of adapting to a new language and culture, they may be subject to security-related police inquiries and violence from right-wing extremist groups. The government has attempted to improve immigrant integration by mandating courses on language, culture, politics, and society for some immigrants. 

Some German states have banned Muslim teachers from wearing [[headscarf|headscarves]] in class and all states have banned crosses from the classroom as well, generally by prohibiting the use of all [[religious symbol]]s by teachers. This is legitimate by combining the German states' privilege of educational laws with the principle of separation of church and state, both provided for in the German federal constitution: According to this legal view, teachers in their vocational function within a state administered educational system are obliged to maintain and publicly exhibit religious neutrality when on duty. As this status of employment does not hold for pupils, whose constitutional right to religious freedom thus remains unencumbered by these provisions, this ban cannot legally be extended to them as it is in [[France]]. The question of headscarves and crosses in schools has been heavily discussed politically throughout Germany in recent years, but could only be solved by a decision of the Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) in 2003.

===Education===
{{main|Education in Germany}}
[[Image:Uni-Heidelberg Aula.jpg|300px|thumb|The [[University of Heidelberg]] is one of the most renowned universities in the world.]]
Germany has one of the world's highest levels of education and many famous universities. The most important foreign languages taught at school are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]]. [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are not taught everywhere. Since the end of [[World War II]], the number of youths entering [[university|universities]] has more than tripled, but university attendance still lags behind many other European nations. In the annual league of top-ranking universities compiled by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Shanghai Jiaotong University]] in 2004, Germany came 4th overall, but with only 7 universities in the top 100 (to compare, the [[United States]] had 51). The highest ranking university, at #45, was the [[Technical University of Munich|TU Munich]]. Most German universities are state-owned and free of charge. Additionally university students are often supported by the so called BAföG, a federal subsidy, running as high as €290 as interest free credit plus €290 as direct payment.

German educational ideals differ considerably from Anglo-Saxon educational ideals, emphasizing socialisation, debate, vocal participation in class and critical faculties. Consequently the results of the [[PISA (student assessment)|PISA student assessments]], that revealed comprehension of the respective subject matters only, were a shock to the German public but no surprise to many educational experts. The comparatively low scores brought on heated debate about how the school system should be changed. Furthermore it was revealed that more than in other countries students with higher-earning parents are better-educated and tend to achieve higher results. There is also some diversity between the schools of the various states that determine their respective school system independently. Failing integration of foreigners also proved to be a big educational obstacle, as in many urban schools teachers are more occupied teaching their numerous foreign students basic German instead of algebra or physics.

Germany prohibits home-schooling; however, this is still practiced by a number of people. There has been some publicity to government prosecution of this practice.

The German school system consists of an elementary school (''Grundschule'') where pupils go for 4 years (1st-4th grade, in some German states to the 6th grade) after that, in some states, they go to a secondary school where they learn English, French or Latin as their first foreign language (erste Fremdsprache). In the 5th grade (the 7th in states with secondary schools) they have to decide whether they will go to a [[Hauptschule]] (5th or 7th-9th or 10th grade), where they only have English as a foreign language and have less chance to get a job, or a [[Realschule]] (7th-10th grade), where they can learn both English and French but also have less chance to get a job, or a [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (5th or 7th-12th or 7th-13th grade), where they learn English and French or Latin. In some schools (''Humanistisches Gymnasium'') they may learn Ancient Greek beginning in the 9th grade. In the 11th grade in a Gymnasium, they may learn Spanish, (Ancient) Greek or Russian (not available at every school). In some states one can learn Chinese, Arabic, Turkish and Japanese beginning from the 11th grade (e.g. [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]). In Germany it is easier to get a job when you have an [[Abitur]], which you get when you have successfully taken the exams at the end of the 12th or 13th grade (the final years at the Gymnasium).
Most German states have the [[Gesamtschule]] (comprehensive school), too. It offers diplomas after the 10th grade (Realschulabschluss, Mittlere Reife) and after the 13th grade ([[Abitur]]).
The school system depends on the state, as a result of German federalism there are huge differences between the states. 

Contrary to the first impression, the Abitur does not correspond with the US high school diploma but with the Associate Degree in college. Germans finish their equivalent of the high school diploma in their 10th grade exams leading to the degree of Mittlere Reife. In the Oberstufe (literally upper level) of Gymnasium they achieve the Allgemeine Hochschulreife (the ability to directly jump into university courses - usually what is achieved in U.S. colleges). This decision of the German states seriously impairs international comparisons of university attendance, as what is usually done in college elsewhere is done in German schools. Considering the high drop-out rates of pre-bachelor courses in the U.S., the low university attendance of Germans might be a statistical myth altogether.

With the Mittlere Reife after the 10th grade (usually at the age of 16), German pupils can also begin an industrial education instead of choosing to go on until the 12th or 13th grade. This [[vocational education]] in the so-called dual educational system (duales Ausbildungssystem) consists of education at a company as well as attending vocational school ([[Berufsschule]]). In three years you are in an apprentice state in the company. The practical parts of your job description are taught at the company, while the theoretical parts are mostly taught at the vocational school. After the three years there are exams held by the chamber of commerce and industry (Industrie- und Handelskammer). Lately there have been reports of apprentices stealing and/or buying exam questions in advance. After the exams companies are normally expected to employ their former apprentices or at least part of them because they cost money to train. Due to subventions for companies taking part in the dual educational system some companies have, however, begun only to train the apprentices for three years and then ditch them for new apprentices and subventions.

For higher qualified work German companies expect German universities to complete the education of the students. Training-on-the-job and the like are either uncommon or simply introductory for students, as companies demand readymade employees from the educational system. Common job offers demand 2+ years of work experience, young age and better than average skills.

Besides the university there is also the [[Fachhochschule]] which is a kind of university. Courses taught at the Fachhochschule are more practically oriented and are expected to result in faster training and better readiness for the job. As with the university you graduate from the Fachhochschule with a [[Diplom]]. The official titles are "Dipl. <branch of study>" for the university and "Dipl. <branch of study> FH" for the Fachhochschule.

Globalization and European unification produced the need for intermediate degrees at the normal university, such as the Bachelor Degree, that has been introduced into the German system in 2005. Again, the German Bachelor Degree differs from international standards as it is a rather hard degree trying to reconcile the economy's demand for readymade employees with a shorttime degree which tends to package the bulk of the original 4,5 year Magister Degree's subject matter into a 3 year course.

==Culture==
[[Image:Goethecut.png|thumb|right|240px|[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] is regarded as a major German poet]]
{{main|Culture of Germany}}

Germany's contributions to the world's cultural heritage are numerous, and the country is often known as ''das Land der Dichter und Denker'' (the land of poets and thinkers). German '''literature''' can be traced back to the Middle Ages, in particular to such authors as [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], considered some of the most important poets of medieval Europe. The fairy tales by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] are world famous and the [[Nibelungenlied]], whose author is not known, is also a major contribution to German literature. Theologian [[Martin Luther|Luther]], who translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for modern "High German" language. The mostly admired German poets and authors are without doubt [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]],  [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]. Other poets include [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], [[Annette von Droste-Hülshoff]], [[Theodor Fontane]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and authors of the 20th century include [[Nobel Prize]] winners [[Thomas Mann]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Heinrich Böll]], and [[Günter Grass]]. Other authors include [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]], [[Karl May|May]]  and [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger|Enzensberger]]. Germany's influence on world '''philosophy''' was significant as well, as exemplified by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Feuerbach]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]],  [[Albert Schweitzer|Schweitzer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]],  [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Eduard von Hartmann|Hartmann]], [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]], [[Rosa Luxemburg|Luxemburg]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], [[Albertus Magnus|Magnus]], [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]], [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]], [[Novalis]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] and [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]]. In the field of '''sociology''' influential German thinkers were [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Max Weber|Weber]], [[Ferdinand Toennies|Tönnies]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]].

Many historical figures, though not citizens of Germany in the modern sense, were important and influential figures in German culture, such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Stefan Zweig]] and [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].


=== German language ===
{{main|German language}}

The '''[[German language]]''' was once the [[lingua franca]] of central, eastern and northern Europe. Within the [[European Union]], German is the language with the most native speakers, with more than English, French, Spanish and Italian. As a foreign language, German is the third most taught worldwide.[http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/www/en/aussenpolitik/kulturpolitik/sprache/deutsch_html] It is also the second most used language on the [[Internet]]. The language has its origin in [[Old High German]]. There are numerous [[dialect]]s of German, many of which are not intelligible to speakers of standard German. Some consider [[Low German]] to be a different language from German; Low German has been given the status of a minority language by the [[European Union]], although it is less used today in the traditionally Low German-speaking areas of northern Germany.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Germany}}

In the field of '''music''', Germany's influence is noted through the works of, among others,
[[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[George Frideric Handel|Händel]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]], [[Heinrich Schütz|Schütz]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn Bartholdy]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Johann Pachelbel|Pachelbel]], [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]], [[Wilhelm Furtwängler|Furtwängler]], [[Hanns Eisler|Eisler]], [[Max Reger|Reger]], [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Carl Orff|Orff]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]], [[Hans Werner Henze|Henze]] and [[Helmut Lachenmann|Lachenmann]].

More recently, Germany has been recognized as the international center for [[electronica]]/trance music. {{fact}}

==Science and technology==
Germany has been the homeland of many great '''scientists''' like [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]], [[Joseph von Fraunhofer|Fraunhofer]], [[Gabriel Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], [[Wilhelm Wundt|Wundt]], [[Rudolf Virchow|Virchow]], [[Paul Ehrlich|Ehrlich]], [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]], [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen|Röntgen]], [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Braun]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Max Born|Born]], [[Max Planck|Planck]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt|Creuzfeldt]], [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz|Hertz]], [[Robert Koch|Koch]], [[Otto Hahn|Hahn]], [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Justus von Liebig|Liebig]], [[Ernst Mayr|Mayr]] and [[Robert Bunsen|Bunsen]]; and inventors and engineers such as [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]], [[Nikolaus Otto|Otto]], [[Hans Geiger|Geiger]], [[Adolf Eugen Fick|Fick]], [[Otto Lilienthal|Lilienthal]], [[Robert Bosch|Bosch]], [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Siemens]], [[Wernher von Braun|von Braun]], [[Ferdinand Porsche|Porsche]], [[Wilhelm Maybach|Maybach]], [[Gottlieb Daimler|Daimler]],  [[Konrad Zuse|Zuse]], [[Carl Benz|Benz]] and [[Rudolf Diesel|Diesel]].

Important '''mathematicians''' were born in Germany such as [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]], [[Friedrich Bessel|Bessel]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauß]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]], [[Adam Ries|Riese]], [[Felix Klein|Klein]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstraß]].

==Transportation== 
{{main|Transport in Germany}}
[[Image:Autobahn 1-999.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of the German autobahn network]]

Due to its central situation in Europe the volume of traffic, especially of goods transit, in Germany is very high. In the past decades, much of the freight traffic shifted from rail to road transport, which led the Federal Government to introduce a motor toll for lorries in 2005. In addition, individual traffic increased to an extent that on German roads, traffic densities are very high by international comparison. For the future, a further strong increase of traffic is expected. Thus, the 2003 federal transportation infrastructure plan scheduled an investment volume of approx. 150 billion euros for the 2001-2015 period, in order to deal with the expected increase in motorised passenger traffic of around 20% (1997-2015) and freight traffic of around 64% (1997-2005).

High speed vehicular traffic has a long tradition in Germany, not only owing to the automobile industry, but also, because the first [[Autobahn]] in the world, the [[AVUS]], and the world's first automobile were built in Germany. Germany possesses one of the densest road systems of the world. It covers 12,037 [[kilometre]]s (7,479&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of federal "Autobahn" motorways and 41,386 kilometres (25,716&nbsp;mi) of federal highways. In contrast to other European countries, German motorways have no blanket [[speed limit]]. However, signposted limits are in place on many dangerous or congested stretches, and where traffic noise or pollution poses a nuisance; some of these limits apply only at night or only in wet conditions. A vehicle is not permitted to use the Autobahn unless it can attain a speed of at least 60&nbsp;km/h (37&nbsp;mph).

Another way to travel is via rail. [[Deutsche Bahn AG|Deutsche Bahn]] (German Rail) is the major German railway infrastructure and service operator. For commuter and regional services, franchises of various sizes are granted by the individual states, though largely financed from the federal budget. Unsubsidised long-range service operators can compete freely all over the country, at least in theory. Actually, Deutsche Bahn holds a de facto monopoly on long-range services, while its market domination in the subsidised, franchise-based commuter train market and the freight market is being slowly eroded by several hundreds of comparatively small competing railways.

[[Frankfurt International Airport]] is a major international airport and European transportation hub. Frankfurt Airport ranks among the world's top ten airports and serves 304 flight destinations in 110 countries. Depending whether total passengers, flights or cargo traffic are used to measure, it ranks as the busiest, second busiest and third busiest in Europe alongside London Heathrow Airport and Paris' Charles de Gaulle.

The [[InterCity Express]] or ICE is a type of high-speed train operated by Deutsche Bahn in Germany and neighbouring countries, for example to Zürich, Switzerland or Vienna, Austria. ICE trains also serve Amsterdam (The Netherlands) as well as Liège and Brussels (Belgium). In spite of branch lines progressively being closed for at least the last seven decades, the rail network throughout Germany is still very extensive and provides excellent services in most areas. On regular lines, at least one train every two hours will call even in the smallest of villages. The quality of rail service differs from state to state, generally being better in the South. Some states and regions have been pioneering the reopening of closed branch lines (notably Rhineland-Palatinate) or the interconnection of tramway and overland rail networks (e.g. around Karlsruhe). Nearly all larger metropolitan areas are being served by an [[S-Bahn]] heavy rail metro system. A large proportion of towns feature underground and/or tram systems. Good urban and overland bus services are ubiquitous.
