The '''Federative Republic of Brazil''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''República Federativa do Brasil'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[ʁe'publikɐ fedeɾa'tʃivɐ du bɾa'ziw]}}{{ref|pronunciation}}) is the largest and [[List of countries by population|most populous country]] in [[Latin America]], and fifth largest in the world. Spanning a vast area between central [[South America]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], it is the easternmost country of the [[Americas]] and it borders [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and the French department of [[French Guiana]]—every South American nation except for [[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]]. Named after [[brazilwood]], (pau-brasil) a tree highly valued by early colonists, Brazil is home to both extensive [[agriculture|agricultural]] lands and [[rain forest]]s. Exploiting vast natural resources and a large labor pool, it is South America's leading economic power and a regional leader. As a former [[colony]] of [[Portugal]], Portuguese is its [[official language]].

==History==
{{main|History of Brazil}}

Brazil is thought to have been inhabited for at least 10,000 years by semi-nomadic populations when the first [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers, led by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], disembarked in 1500. Over the next three centuries, it was resettled by the Portuguese and exploited mainly for [[brazilwood]] (Pau-Brasil) at first, and later for [[sugarcane]] (Cana-de-Açúcar) agriculture and [[gold mining]]. The colony's source of manpower was initially on [[Slavery#Slavery in Brazil|enslaved]] [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindians]], and after 1550, mainly [[African]] slaves. In 1808, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and her son and regent, the future [[John VI of Portugal|João VI of Portugal]], fleeing from [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], relocated to Brazil with the royal family, nobles and government. Though they returned to Portugal in 1821, the interlude led to the opening of commercial ports to the [[United Kingdom]] &mdash; at the time isolated from most European ports by Napoleon &mdash; and to the elevation of Brazil to the status of a united kingdom with Portugal's Crown. Then prince regent [[Peter I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]] (later Pedro IV of Portugal) declared independence on [[7 September]] [[1822]], establishing the independent [[Empire of Brazil]]. As the crown remained in the hands of the [[House of Braganza|house of Bragança]], this was more the severance of the Portuguese empire in two, than an independence movement as seen elsewhere in the Americas. 
[[Image:Ouro_Preto.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Ouro Preto]], Historical city of [[XVIII century]].]]
The Brazilian Empire was theoretically a democracy in the [[Westminster system|British style]], although in practice, the emperor-premier-parliament balance of power more closely resembled the autocratic [[Austrian Empire]]. Slavery was abolished in 1888, and intensive European immigration created the basis for industrialization. Pedro I was succeeded by his son, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] &mdash; who in old age was caught by a political dispute between the Army and the Cabinet, a crisis arising from the [[War of the Triple Alliance|Paraguay War]]. In order to avoid a civil war between Army and Navy, Pedro II renounced the throne on [[15 November]] [[1889]], when a [[federal republic]] was established by [[Marechal Deodoro da Fonseca|Field Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca]].

In the late [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th]] centuries, Brazil attracted over 5 million [[Europe]]an and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrants. That period also saw Brazil industrialize, further colonize, and develop its interior. Brazilian democracy was replaced by [[dictatorship]]s three times &mdash; 1930&ndash;1934 and 1937&ndash;1945 under [[Getúlio Vargas]], and 1964&ndash;1985, under a succession of generals appointed by the military. Today, Brazil is internationally considered a [[democracy]] since 1985, specifically a [[president]]ial democracy, which was kept after a [[plebiscite]] in 1993 where voters had to choose between a presidential or [[parliamentary system]]s, whilst also choosing if Brazil should reinstate its [[constitutional monarchy]].

==Regions and States==
{{main|States of Brazil}}
Brazil consists of 26 states (''estados'', singular ''estado'') and 1 federal district (''distrito federal''):
[[Image:Br-map.png|thumb|200px|Map of Brazil]]
Brazil and its 26 states and Federal District are divided by [[IBGE]] into 5 distinctive [[region]]s: [[North Region, Brazil|North]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-West]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[South Region, Brazil|South]] ([[Regions of Brazil|Division by Regions]]).([[Regions of Brazil|Division by Regions]]).

*North: [[Acre (state)|Acre]], [[Amapá]], [[Amazonas]], [[Pará]], [[Rondônia]], [[Roraima]] and [[Tocantins (state)|Tocantins]]. 

The North constitutes 45.27% of the surface of Brazil and it is simultaneously the region with the lowest number of inhabitants. It is a fairly unindustrialized and undeveloped region, but it accommodates the largest rainforest of the world, the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]], and many [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] tribes. 

[[Image:Praia_de_Fortaleza.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Fortaleza]] the State capital of [[Ceará]], located in northeastern Brazil.]]
*Northeast: [[Alagoas]], [[Bahia]], [[Ceará]], [[Maranhão]], [[Paraíba]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Piauí]], [[Rio Grande do Norte]] and [[Sergipe]].

The Northeast has 1/3 of Brazil's population. The region is culturally diverse, with roots from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonial period, [[Afro-Brazilian]] culture and some [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Brazilian Indian]] influence. It is also the poorest region of Brazil, with long periods of [[dry]] [[climate]]. It is well-known for its beautiful [[coast]].

*Central-West: [[Goiás]], [[Mato Grosso]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] and [[Brazilian Federal District|Federal District]]. 

The Central-West is the second largest region of Brazil, but has a low demographic density, since most of the population is concentrated in large cities.  It is where the capital of Brazil, [[Brasília]], is located. The region also accommodates the [[Pantanal]], the world’s largest wetland area.
[[Image:BH11.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Belo Horizonte]] capital of [[Minas Gerais]] in Southeast region.]]
*Southeast: [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Espírito Santo]], [[Minas Gerais]] and [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]

The Southeast is the richest and most populated region of Brazil. It has more inhabitants than any other South American country, with two of the largest [[megalopolis |megalopolises]] of the world: [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], the largest producer of oil and gas in Brazil. The region is very diverse, including the major business center of São Paulo, the [[Historical]] cities of Minas Gerais, the world famous beaches of Rio de Janeiro, and the Espírito Santo beautiful coast.

*South: [[Paraná]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]
[[Image:Blumenau2.JPG|thumb|200px|Strong influence from [[German people|German]] immigrants in [[Blumenau]], Southern region]]

The South is the wealthiest per capta region of Brazil, with the highest [[standard of living]] in the country.  It is also the [[cold|coldest]] part of Brazil, with occasional occurrences of [[frost|frosts]] and [[snowstorms]]. The region has been heavily settled by [[European]] [[immigrants]], mainly [[German-Brazilian|Germans]] and [[Italian Brazilian|Italians]], and shows clear influences from both cultures.

Brazil is a [[melting-pot]] of different ethnicities and origins.

The dominant ancestry among Brazilians is the [[Portuguese-Brazilian|Portuguese]], descendants of the early colonists or of 19th and 20th centuries Portuguese immigrants. The settlement of Portuguese started in Brazil after 1532, when the active process of colonization began since the founding of [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]]. Until independence in 1822, the Portuguese were the only [[European]] nation that successfully settled in Brazil, and most of Brazil's culture is based on that of [[Portugal]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and the [[French people|French]] also colonized Brazil during the 17th century, but their presence lasted only a few decades.

The original [[Amerindian]] population of Brazil (between 3-5 million) has in large part been exterminated or assimilated into the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] population. Since the beginning of Brazil's [[colonization]], intermarriage between the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Native Brazilians]] has been common. Nowadays, there are 700,000 Native-Americans in Brazil, comprising less than 1% of the national population.
[[Image:Kuarup3.jpg|left|framed|[[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Brazilian Indians]].]]

Brazil has a large [[black]] population, descended from [[African]] [[slaves]] brought to the country from the 16th century until the 19th century. More than 3 million Africans were brought to Brazil until the end of slave trafficking in 1850. They were mainly from [[Angola]], [[Nigeria]], [[Benin]], [[Togo]], [[Ghana]], the [[Ivory Coast]] and [[São Tomé e Príncipe]]. Brazil has the largest population of African descended people after Nigeria.  The African population in Brazil has mixed substantially with the Portuguese, resulting in a large [[mixed-race]] population. 

Beginning in the 19th century, the Brazilian government stimulated [[European]] [[immigration]] to substitute for the manpower of the former slaves. The first non-Portuguese [[immigrants]] to settle in Brazil were [[German-Brazilian|Germans]], in 1824. In 1869 the first [[Poles|Polish]] immigrants settled in Brazil. However, strong [[Immigration in Brazil|European immigration]] to Brazil began only after 1875, when immigration from [[Italy]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] increased. According to the [http://www.memorialdoimigrante.sp.gov.br// Memorial do Imigrante], between 1870 and 1953, Brazil attracted nearly 5.5 million immigrants, [[Italian Brazilian|Italians]] (1,550,000), [[Portuguese-Brazilian|Portuguese]] (1,470,000), [[Spanish Brazilian|Spaniards]] (650,000), [[German-Brazilian|Germans]] (210,000), [[Japanese-Brazilian|Japanese]] (190,000), [[Poles]] or [[Russian people|Russian]] (120,000) and 650,000 of many other nationalities. Brazil is home to the largest [[Italian people|Italian]] population outside of Italy, with 25 million Italians and [[Italian Brazilian|Italian-descended Brazilians]].

Starting in the early 20th century, Brazil also received a large number of Asians: [[Korean people|Korean]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Taiwan]]ese, and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrants. The Japanese are the largest [[Asian]] minority in Brazil, and [[Japanese-Brazilian]]s are the largest Japanese population outside of [[Japan]] (1.5 million). Significant immigration from the [[Middle-East]] ([[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]) has also occurred.

Brazil's population is mostly concentrated along the coast, with a lower population density in the interior. The population of the southern states is mainly of European descent, while the majority of the inhabitants of the north and northeast are of mixed ancestry (Amerindians, Africans and Europeans).

===Ethnicity and race===
According to the 2000 [[IBGE]] census:

*white 53.7%
*mixed race 38.5%
*black 6.2%
*asian 0.5%
*amerindian 0.4%
*unspecified 0.7%

White Brazilians are a mix of several European ethnic groups, mainly [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italian people|Italians]], [[German people|Germans]], [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] and [[Poles|Poles]]. The [[Portuguese-Brazilian]] ancestry predominates, although 30% of white Brazilians have some [[Italian Brazilian]] descent, 15% have [[German-Brazilian]] descent,another 15% [[Spanish Brazilian]][http://www.mae.es/es/MenuPpal/Paises/ArbolPaises/Brasil/Nota+pais/] and 2% [[Polish Brazilian]] origin. Minority ancestries includes [[Austrian people|Austrian]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], [[Russian people|Russian]], [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]], [[Lithuania|Lithuanian]] and [[Swiss people|Swiss]], among others. 

Brazilians of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry are found in the entire country, while those of [[Italian people|Italian]] descent are predominantly in Southern and Southeastern Brazil. The other white ethnic groups, mainly Brazilians of [[German people|German]] descent, are concentrated in the extreme South of Brazil. There are entire cities settled by [[German-Brazilian|Germans-Brazilians]] in Southern Brazil. [[Image:Capoeira-in-the-street-2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Afro-Brazilian]] [[Capoeira]] art]]

There is a considerable number of [[Japanese-Brazilian|Japanese]] descendants. Brazil has the largest Japanese descended population in the world outside of Japan, with estimated 1.5 million people.

Brazilians of [[mixed-race]] ancestry are found in the whole country, although most of them live in the Northern and Northeastern states. Mixed-race Brazilians include [[mulatto]], [[caboclo]] (or [[mameluco]]) and [[cafuzo]]. The mulattoes, those mixed white and black, make up the majority of them and predominate in the coast of Northeastern Brazil and other parts of the country. Caboclos, mixed white and Amerindian, are found in Northern region, parts of Northeast, Southeast (offsprings from [[bandeirantes]] and [[gauchos]]) and the cafuzos, those mixed black and Amerindian, are the less numerous group, living mainly in the Northeastern part of Brazil. However, most mixed race Brazilians are in fact tri-racial, mixed whites, blacks and Amerindians.

[[Black people|Black]] Brazilians are concentrated mostly in the Northeastern states, although large black populations can be found throughout the country. The black population in Brazil is probably higher than 6.2%, since many black Brazilians classify themselves as ''mixed-race'', due to local cultural and social aspects when considering the subject of race.

[[Asian Brazilian|Asian Brazilians]] (mainly of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] descent) and [[Arab Brazilian|Arab Brazilians]] are concentrated in the Southeastern states (mainly in [[São Paulo]]). The population of [[Arab]] descent in Brazil is between 5-8 million people, most of them of [[Christian]] [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] or [[Syria|Syrian]] descent.

[[Amerindian]] Brazilians are concentrated in the Northern states, mostly in the [[Amazonas|Amazon]] area.  [[Indian reservations]] make up 10% of Brazil's territory.

Racism in Brazil is an unbailable crime.

==Languages==
[[Image:Corcovado_statue01_2005-03-14.jpg||250px|right|thumb|[[Corcovado]] hill in [[Rio de Janeiro]] with Jesus Christ the Redeemer statue]]

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official language, and is spoken by the entire population. Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in [[the Americas]], giving it a national culture distinct from its [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking neighbors.

Portuguese is the only official language of Brazil, and there are few regional variances. It is virtually the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio and TV, and for all business and administrative purposes.

The language spoken in Brazil is slightly different from that spoken in [[Portugal]] and other Portuguese-speaking countries. [[Brazilian Portuguese]] is more archaic than [[European Portuguese]], and has some phonological and orthographic differences, although mutual comprehension is not affected.

Spanish is understood in various degrees by most people, since it is very similar to Portuguese and is spoken in the border of Brazil with Spanish-speaking countries. [[English language|English]] is part of the official high school curriculum, but very few people achieve any usable degree of fluency.

Many minority languages are spoken daily throughout the vast national territory of Brazil. Half of these languages are spoken by indigenous peoples, mostly in Northern Brazil. The main indigenous languages are: [[Tupi language|Tupi]], [[Guarani language|Guarani]] (also in Paraguay), [[Kaingang language|Kaingang]], [[Nadëb language|Nadëb]], [[Carajá language|Carajá]], [[Caribe language|Caribe]], [[Tucano language|Tucano]], [[Arára language|Arára]], [[Terêna language|Terêna]], [[Borôro language|Borôro]], [[Apalaí language|Apalaí]], [[Canela language|Canela]] and many others.

Still others are spoken by communities of descendants of immigrants, who are for the most part bilingual, in rural areas of Southern Brazil. These communities speak dialects of [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[Polish language|Polish]] or [[Japanese language|Japanese]] languages. The most dominant spoken Brazilian German dialect is [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]], a Brazilian variation of the [[Hunsrückisch]]
dialect of German. [[Talian]] is the main spoken [[Italian dialects|Italian dialect]] in Brazil, and is based on the [[Venetian Language]], which has its origin in Northern [[Italy]].

[[German language|German]] is spoken as first language by 1.500.000 people, [[Italian language|Italian]] is spoken by 500.000, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] by 400.000 and  [[Korean language]] by 37.000. However, these non-Portuguese speaking immigrants communities in Brazil are in full decline, especially among teenagers, who learn primary [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

==Religion==
[[Image:NS Aparecida.png|thumb|150px|[[Our Lady of Aparecida]] is the Patroness of Brazil.]]
''Main article: [[Religion in Brazil]]''

About 74% of the population in Brazil are [[Roman Catholic]]. Followers of [[Protestantism]] are rising in number, currently at 15.4%. [[Spiritism]] constitutes 1.3% of the population (about 2,3 million) and is the country with the most adepts of this religion. African traditional religions such as [[Candomblé]], Macumba, and Umbanda are the next largest groups.  There are around 120,000 members of the Jewish community (located mostly in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro but also in Brasilia, Curitiba, Porto Alegre and other major towns) while Buddhism, Shinto, and other Asian religions are also sizeable. There are around 28,000 muslims, or 0.01% of the population.  Some practice a mixture of different religions, such as Catholicism, Candomble and indigenous American religion combined.

Brazil is the country with the largest [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] population in the world, as well the country with the most members of [[Asia|Asian]] religions in the [[Western world]].

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Brazil}}
{{see also|List of Brazilian companies|Bovespa}}

Possessing large and well-developed [[agriculture|agricultural]], [[mining]], [[manufacturing]], and [[service sector]]s, as well as a large labor pool, Brazil's GDP (PPP) outweighs that of any other [[Latin America]]n country, and the country is expanding its presence in world markets. Major export products include [[airplanes]], [[coffee]], [[vehicles]], [[soybean]], [[iron ore]], [[orange juice]], [[steel]], [[textiles]], [[footwear]] and [[electrical equipment]]. 

After forming a fiscal adjustment program and pledging progress on structural reform, Brazil received a US$41.5 billion [[IMF]]-led international support program in November 1998. [http://www.canadianliberty.bc.ca/relatedinfo/BRAZIL'S_IMF_DISASTER.html] During the summer of 1998, investors expressed concerns that a downturn in economic growth was imminent. However, in January 1999, the Brazilian Central Bank announced that the [[Brazilian real|Real]] would no longer be related to the [[US dollar]] value. This devaluation helped moderate the downturn, and the country posted moderate [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] growth.

Economic growth slowed considerably in 2001 &mdash; to less than 2% &mdash; because of a slowdown in major markets, the hiking of interest rates by the Central Bank to reduce [[inflation]]ary pressures, and fears over the economic policies of the new elected government. Investor confidence was strong at the end of 2001, in part because of the strong recovery in the balance of trade. Chronic poverty remains a pressing problem.

After [[Lula da Silva|Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] took office on [[1 January]] [[2003]], there was some fear that his party radicals might provoke an economic about-face, and that Brazil might experience a financial crisis. However, the Brazilian economy seems to have detached itself from politics, and after a GDP increase of 0.5% in 2003, Brazil has allegedly enjoyed a robust growth in 2004. It is estimated that there will be moderate growth in 2005 and 2006. Despite this, Brazil has consistently dropped 11 positions on the [[WEF]] Growth Competitiveness Index ranking from 2003 to 2005 [http://www.weforum.org/pdf/Gcr/Growth_Competitiveness_Index_2003_Comparisons][http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Growth+Competitiveness+Index+rankings+2005+and+2004+comparisons]. However, as of January 10, 2006, the IMF has shown satisfaction[http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2006/011006.htm] with Brazil's economic policies.

==Poverty, illiteracy and income concentration==
[[Image:RiodeJaneiro-Favela.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Rocinha]], a [[Rio de Janeiro]] favela]]
Brazil currently has 45 million people living in conditions of [[poverty]]. This is a critical issue.

Poverty in Brazil can be seen in the large metropolitan areas (capitals) and in the "pockets of poverty" (upcountry regions with low rates of economic and social development). The [[Northeast]] has chronic problems as a result of its  [[dry]] [[climate]], with millions of people suffering [[hunger]] during the dry seasons. President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] has proposed a program ([[Fome Zero]]) to mitigate this problem but its success is disputed.

About 8% of the Brazilian population is officially considered illiterate (''analfabetos'' in Portuguese) but over 30% of the total population do not have capacity to read and write texts, although a growing percentage show some writing and computing abilities.[http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/datas/alfabetizacao/alfabetizacao.html]

==Technology==
 
Brazil has important technology poles located at [[São José dos Campos]] ([[aerospace]] and [[telecommunications]]) , [[Campinas]] ([[software]], [[computers]]) , [[São Carlos]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Curitiba]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[São Paulo]].



==Culture==
[[Image:CarnavalBrazilRio2005.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Brazilian Carnival]].]]

Brazil is a multiracial country, and its culture reflects the wide variety of ethnic groups found in the country: [[Amerindians]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Africans]], [[Italian people|Italians]], [[German people|Germans]], [[Spanish people|Spaniards]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Arabs]], etc. As result of intense mixing of peoples, a rich mix of different cultures has been synthesized.

==Sports==
{{main|Sports in Brazil}}
[[Image:Brazilian team soccer53467.jpeg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Brazil national football team]] scores a goal in Haiti.]]

The most popular sport in Brazil is [[Football (soccer)]]. The [[Brazil national football team|National Team]] is immensely popular, not only in Brazil but also in the many parts of the world where football is appreciated, and there is also a renowned National League, boasting a nation-wide competition as well as several regional competitions. The Brazilian national team has been victorious in the [[World Cup]] tournament a record five times. [[Pele]], one of the world's most recognized players, led Brazil to three of those championships. After the third time, Brazil kept the [[World Cup trophy]] permanently. Some of the contemporary talents in the national team prominent in the football world include [[Romário]], [[Rivaldo]] and [[Ronaldo]]. The current holder of the title of best football player in the world, according to [[FIFA]], is [[Ronaldinho]], who won the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] prize in 2004 and 2005.

Three other variations of football are widely practiced by Brazilians, namely [[Futsal]], an indoor version with teams composed of 5 players, beach football, which originated in the beaches of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Footvolley]], which is a mix of football and volleyball, where the players must use their feet and head to get the ball over the net and into the opponent's court, and is also played in sand.

Volleyball is also a very popular sport in Brazil. National and state leagues are popular and enjoy good public attendance. Television coverage is more limited. Brazil's national team has also been very successful, particularly in winning men's gold medals in the 1992 and 2004 Olympic Games. [[Beach volleyball]] has also given Brazilian athletes much success worldwide, today Brazil is the ruling country, with six of its players in the first six positions of FIVB ranking: these include Emanuel Rego, Ricardo Santos, Marcio Araujo and others.

Basketball is also popular, but lost popularity after the increased attention volleyball has gained recently. The Brazilian national team has won the [[Basketball World Championship]] twice, in 1959 and 1963. Brazilian [[Oscar Schmidt]] was one of the best basketball players of basketball history.  

Recently tennis has also raised interest. [[Gustavo Kuerten]] (a.k.a. Guga) reached number 1 status in the ATP world ranking in 2001, having won the Roland Garros French Open 3 times (1997, 2000 and 2001).

[[Auto racing]] has also been very popular for a very long time, and Brazil has produced some Formula One world champions: [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] (1972 and 1974), [[Nelson Piquet]] (1981, 1983 and 1987) and [[Ayrton Senna]] (1988, 1990 and 1991), as well as an [[Indy Racing League]] champion, [[Tony Kanaan]] in 2004.

Sailing is another strong sport, in spite of the fact that is an elite sport. 

[[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], a regional martial art, is a significant extension to the original [[jiu-jitsu]]. It is renowned with martial artists throughout the world.
