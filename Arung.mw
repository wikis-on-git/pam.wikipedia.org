Anatomically, a '''nose''' is a protuberance in [[vertebrate]]s that houses the [[nostril]]s, or nares, which admit and expel air for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] in conjunction with the [[mouth]].

In most humans, it also houses the [[nosehairs]], which catch airborne particles and prevent them from reaching the lungs.  Within and behind the nose is the [[olfactory mucosa]] and the [[sinus]]es.  Behind the [[nasal cavity]], air next passes through the [[pharynx]], shared with the digestive system, and then into the rest of the [[respiratory system]]. In humans, the nose is located centrally on the face; on most other [[mammal]]s, it is on the upper tip of the snout.    

As an interface between the body and the external world, the nose and associated structures frequently perform additional functions concerned with conditioning entering air (for instance, by warming and/or humidifying it) and by mostly reclaiming moisture from the air before it is exhaled (as occurs most efficiently in [[camel]]s).
  
In most mammals, the nose is the primary organ for [[olfaction|smelling]]. As the animal sniffs, the air flows through the nose and over structures called [[turbinate]]s in the [[nasal cavity]]. The turbulence caused by this disruption slows the air and directs it toward the [[olfactory epithelium]]. At the surface of the olfactory epithelium, [[odor]] molecules carried by the air contact [[olfactory receptor neuron]]s which transduce the features of the molecule into electrical impulses in the [[brain]].

In [[cetacean]]s, the nose has been reduced to the nostrils, which have migrated to the top of the head, producing a more streamlined body shape and the ability to breathe while mostly submerged. Conversely, the [[elephant]]'s nose has become elaborated into a long, muscular, manipulative organ called the ''trunk''.
