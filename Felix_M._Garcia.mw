'''Poet/Writer/Columnist'''

 
Born on January 30, 1938 to spouses Raymundo Garcia and Gregoria Mauricio 
in Tacasan, Macabebe, Pampanga (Philippines), '''FELIX M. GARCIA''', whose father 
was a vernacular poet, is one common person who has less in life in terms of material
possession, but he was enriched by his father's precious gift - the gift of power to 
write literary works. He was an undergraduate, but his lack of education did not deter 
him from soaring high in promoting the craft he inherited from his father. He wrote 
numerous literary works that gained him prominence and distinction in the field of arts 
and culture. He was only 15 years old when he wrote his first Zarzuela play entitled "Bunga ning Dewacan" (Fruit of Evil).

Numerous awards were given him particularly the "Outstanding Playwright
-Director" in 1990, which was awarded by Lira Pampangue√±a (Central Luzon Writers-
Poets League) and the "Most Outstanding Kapampangan in Pampango Literature"
given in 1999 by MOKA, in conjunction with the province's 428th Foundation Day and, a three-time (3) recipient of different awards in writing competitions held by the same awarding body during the incumbency of the then Governor Bren Z. Guiao.

His works in English include "The Story of a Tree"; An Advice to a Drinker"; "A
Man's Wish"; "The Lords Prayer", (Poet's Modern Version on World Peace); "Give 
Peace a Chance" (on World Brotherhood and Peace Through Poetry); and "Give Peace a Chance in Mindanao", his entry on Anthology during the 16th World Congress of Poets of the United Poets Laureate International held on August 2 - 6, 2000 at the Mimosa Leisure Estate, Angeles City (Philippines), in which he was given a Certificate of Merit in Recognition and Appreciation of Excellence in Poetry for World Brotherhood and Peace. He is a columnist not only for one newspaper of general circulation and, at the time of this publication he is an Editor-in-Chief to a certain newsweekly in his province. 

Garcia is happily married to Milagros T. Viray-Garcia of San Simon, Pampanga
with whom he has nine (9) children, four of whom are boys and are likely to inherit
their father's love of poetry and skills in writing.
