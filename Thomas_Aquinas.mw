'''Saint Thomas Aquinas''' ['''Thomas of Aquin''', or '''Aquino'''] (c. 1225 &ndash; [[7 March]] [[1274]]) was a [[philosopher]] and [[theology|theologian]] in the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, known as '''Doctor Angelicus, Doctor Universalis'''.  He is the foremost classical proponent of [[natural theology]], and the father of the [[Thomism|Thomistic]] school of philosophy, which was long the primary philosophical approach of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The work for which he is best-known is the ''[[Summa Theologiae]]''. One of the thirty-three [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]], he is considered by many Catholics to be the Church's greatest theologian.  Consequently, many [[Institutions named after Thomas Aquinas|institutions of learning]] have been named after him.
