The following templates:
:{{lt|Coord/input/dec}}
:{{lt|Coord/input/d}}
:{{lt|Coord/input/dm}}
:{{lt|Coord/input/dms}}
:{{lt|Coord/input/ERROR}}

:{{lt|Coord/display/inline}}
:{{lt|Coord/display/title}}
:{{lt|Coord/display/inline,title}}

are "subroutines" of {{tl|Coord}}.  Separating them this way allows &#123;{Coord}&#125; to include only one of them instead of all of them, drastically reducing the pre-expand size.  They shouldn't be used directly.
