==City==
The name "Porbandar" came from the combination of two words: "Porai", the name of a local goddess, and "Bandar" means port or harbour. Thus, 'Porbandar' translates to 'Porai's harbour'. Several sources refer to the area as 'Pauravelakul', a name known to have been in use during the 10th century; this ancient name may possibly translate to 'land of Porai's clan' or to that effect. The town finds mention in the [[Indian epic poetry|Hindu epic]]s as the hometown of Sudama, a beloved friend and class-fellow of lord [[Krishna]]; the town has also often been referred to as 'Sudamapuri' on that account.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSWzFz-tGrM/Voice Of Gandhiji]

==History==
===Harappan settlement (1600-1400 BC)===
Onshore explorations in and around Porbandar brought to light for the first time the remains of a late [[Harappan]] settlement dating back to the [[16th century BC|16th]] - 14th century BC, which is similar to that from Bet [[Dwarka]]. This is another evidence to suggest that the Harappan legacy of [[Sea|maritime]] activity continued till the late Harappan period on the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] coast. The discovery of ancient jetties along the Porbandar creek signifies the importance of Porbandar as an active centre of maritime activities in the past. This is an Darji
community

===Princely Porbandar (1600 AD onwards)===
Porbandar was formerly the seat of the eponymous [[princely state]] in [[British India]]. The ruling family of the state belonged to the [[Jethwa]] clan of [[rajput]]s and had been established in the area since at least the mid 16th century. The state was subordinate to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] governor of Gujarat until being overrun by the [[maratha]]s in the latter half of the 18th century, whereafter they came under the authority of the [[Gaekwad]] court at [[Vadodara|Baroda]], and eventually of the [[Peshwa]]. In common with the other states of [[Kathiawar]], the state first came into the ambit of British influence in 1807, when the [[British East India Company|HEIC]] guaranteed security in the area in lieu of a fixed annual tribute to be paid to the Peshwa and the Gaekwad. In 1817, the Peshwa ceded his share to the HEIC; in 1820, the Gaekwad agreed to have the HIEC collect his due tributes in Kathiawar and remit the same to his treasury.

During the [[British Raj|Raj]], the state covered an area of 1,663 sq.km, encompassing 106 villages and a population, in 1921, of over 100,000 people. It enjoyed a revenue of Rs.21,00,000/-. By 1947, the rulers held the style of "Highness" and the title of "Maharaj Rana Sahib"; they were entitled to a salute of 13 guns as a hereditary distinction.

Upon the [[Independence of India]] in 1947, the state acceded unto the [[dominion of India]]. It was merged with the 'United state of Kathiawar' with effect from [[February 15]], [[1948]] and eventually came to form part of the present-day state of [[Gujarat]].

==Current situation==

[[Image:Githa Mandir-PBR2.jpg|right|thumb|Mahatma Gandhi's image in<br>the Gita Mandir, Porbandar]]

Despite being the birthplace of one of the most famous leaders of the world, Porbandar lacks any significant tourism infrastructure, although the area around Mahatma Gandhi's home has been renovated to become a temple of peace.

The major complaint of tourists is that the town is not known well enough, and that the bad traffic scenario means that bus journeys take many hours.

Porbandar has an excellent beach and a brilliant azure sea which could become a tourism hot spot, however the government has failed to assure cleanliness and although the ocean itself is pristine, reconstruction activities were carried on to give the chowpati (Beach) a new look by some collector in around 2003 and now it hold well arranged sitting arrangement for tourist and commuters and there is also a skating platform for children. Although the local civic body is not paying enough attention for cleanliness, their condition can be said to be better than many beaches across the country.

The main business in Porbandar is Fishing and Fish Export, The leading Fish exporter from Gujarat is SILVER SEAFOOD ( www.silverseafoods.com )which is a pride to Porbandar, Fishing industries give a lot of employments to the local and to near by district. 

Present Member of [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] is Harilal Madhavji Patel.
Present Member of [[Gujarat Legislative Assembly]] is Arjunbhai Modhvadia.
