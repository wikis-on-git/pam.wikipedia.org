'''''Mimosa pudica''''' ('''Sensitive Plant''') (''pudica'' = shy), is a creeping annual or perennial [[herb]] often grown for its curiosity value: the compound leaves fold inward and droop when touched or shaken, re-opening within minutes. The species is native to [[South America]] and [[Central America]], but is now a pantropical weed. 

==Description==
[[File:Mimosa pudica W2 IMG_2374.jpg|thumb|190px|left|''Mimosa pudica'' in [[Goa]], [[India]]. ]]
The stem is erect in young plants, but becomes creeping or trailing with age.  The stem is slender, branching, and sparsely to densely prickly, growing to a length of 1.5 m (5&nbsp;ft). The leaves of the mimosa pudica are compound leaves.  
The leaves are [[Pinnate|bipinnately]] compound, with one or two pinnae pairs, and 10-26 leaflets per pinna. The petioles are also prickly. [[Peduncle (botany)|Pedunculate]] (stalked) pale pink or purple [[head (botany)|flower heads]] arise from the leaf axils.  The globose to ovoid heads are 8–10&nbsp;mm in diameter (excluding the stamens). On close examination, it is seen that the floret petals are red in their upper part and the filaments are pink to lavender. The [[fruit]] consists of clusters of 2-8 pods from 1–2&nbsp;cm long each, these prickly on the margins.  The pods break into 2-5 segments and contain pale brown seeds some 2.5&nbsp;mm long. The flowers are pollinated by the wind and insects.<ref name=Forest>{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/global/iitf/pdf/shrubs/Mimosa%20pudica.pdf |title=''Mimosa pudica'' L. |accessdate=2008-03-25|publisher=US Forest Service}}</ref> The seeds have hard seed coats which restricts germination.<ref>{{Citation| title = Germination, emergence, and dormancy of Mimosa pudica| year = 2009| journal = Weed Biology and Management| pages = 38–45| volume = 9| issue = 1| doi = 10.1111/j.1445-6664.2008.00316.x| last1 = Chauhan	 | first1 =  Bhagirath S.

===Plant movement===
''Mimosa pudica'' is well known for its [[rapid plant movement]].
[[Image:Mimosa pudica closed.JPG|left|thumb|''Mimosa pudica'' with leaves closed]]
Like a number of other plant species, it undergoes changes in leaf orientation termed "sleep" or [[nyctinastic]] movement.  The foliage closes during darkness and reopens in light.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Raven | first1 = Peter H. | last2 = Evert | first2 = Ray Franklin | last3 = Eichhorn | first3 = Susan E. | title = Biology of plants | date = 2005 | publisher = W.H. Freeman and Company | location = New York  | isbn = 978-0-7167-1007-3 | page = 639 }}</ref>

The leaves also close under various other stimuli, such as touching,warming, blowing, or shaking. These types of movements have been termed [[thigmonasty|seismonastic]] movements. The movement occurs when specific regions of cells lose [[turgor pressure]], which is the force that is applied onto the cell wall by water within the cell vacuoles and other cell contents.  When the plant is disturbed, specific regions on the stems are stimulated to release chemicals which force water out of the cell vacuoles and the water diffuses out of the cells, producing a loss of cell pressure and cell collapse; this differential turgidity between different regions of cells results in the closing of the leaflets and the collapse of the leaf [[petiole]]. This characteristic is quite common within the [[Mimosaceae]] family. The stimulus can also be transmitted to neighboring leaves.  It is not known exactly why ''Mimosa pudica'' evolved this trait, but many scientists think that the plant uses its ability to shrink as a defense from predators. Animals may be afraid of such a fast moving plant and would rather go and eat a less active one.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Taxonomy and nomenclature==
''Mimosa pudica'' was first formally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753.<ref name>{{APNI | name =''Mimosa pudica''| id =20037 }}</ref>  The species epithet, ''pudica'', is [[Latin]] for "bashful" or "shrinking", alluding to its shrinking reaction to contact.

===Common names===
The species is known by numerous common names including

In Urdu it is known as CHui-Mui. In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], this is known as 'Lojjaboti', the shy virgin. In [[Indonesia]], it is known as ''Putri Malu'' (Shy Princess). In Myanmar (Burma) it is called 'Hti Ka Yoan' which means "crumbles when touched".

==Distribution==
''Mimosa pudica'' is native to [[South America]] and [[Central America]]. It has been introduced to many other regions and is regarded as an [[invasive species]] in [[Tanzania]], [[South Asia]] and [[South East Asia]] and many [[Pacific Islands]].<ref name=Usambara>{{cite web |url=http://www.tropical-biology.org/research/dip/species/Mimosa%20pudica.htm |title=Mimosa pudica |work= Usambara Invasive Plants |accessdate=2008-03-25 |publisher=Tropical Biology Association}}</ref> It is regarded as invasive in parts of [[Australia]] and is a declared weed in the [[Northern Territory]],<ref>>{{cite web |url=http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/natres/weeds/ntweeds/declared.html |title=Declared Weeds in the NT - Natural Resources, Environment and The Arts |accessdate=2008-03-25 }}</ref> and [[Western Australia]] although not naturalized there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agspsrv95.agric.wa.gov.au/dps/version02/01_plantview.asp?page=7&contentID=60& |title=Declared Plants- Sensitive plant common (Mimosa pudica) |accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref> Control is recommended in [[Queensland]].<ref name=Biosecurity>{{cite web |url=http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/cps/rde/xbcr/dpi/IPA-Common-Sensitive-Plant-PP38.pdf |title=Common Sensitive Plant |accessdate=2008-03-25 |work=Invasive plants and animals|publisher=Biosecurity Queensland}}</ref> It has also been introduced to [[Nigeria]], [[Seychelles]], [[Mauritius]] and [[East Asia]] but is not regarded as invasive in those places.<ref name=Usambara/> It also grows in parts of [[Florida]], [[Alabama]] and [[Louisiana]], in the [[United States of America]].

==Agricultural impacts==
[[File:Mimosa pudica W IMG_2376.jpg|thumb|190px|''Mimosa pudica'' in [[Goa]], [[India]]. ]]

The species can be a troublesome weed in tropical crops, particularly when fields are hand cultivated. Crops it tends to affect are corn, coconuts, tomatoes, cotton, coffee, bananas, soybeans, papaya, and sugar cane. Dry thickets may become a fire hazard.<ref name=Forest/> In some cases it has become a forage plant although the variety in [[Hawaii]] is reported to be toxic to livestock.<ref name=Forest/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hear.org/pier/species/mimosa_pudica.htm |title=''Mimosa pudica'' (PIER species info) |accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref>

''Mimosa pudica'' can form root nodules that are inhabitable by [[nitrogen fixing bacteria]]. The bacteria are able to convert atmospheric nitrogen, which plants can not use, into a form that plants can use. This trait is common among plants in the [[Fabaceae]] family.

==Cultivation==
In cultivation, this plant is most often grown as an indoor [[annual plant|annual]], but is also grown for groundcover. Propagation is generally by seed.
