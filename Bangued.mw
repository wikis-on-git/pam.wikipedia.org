Transportation by land is the only mode of transportation in the municipality. Passenger buses, mini-buses, jeepneys and tricycles including cargo are the major means of transportation. Buses, mini-buses and jeepneys are playing the longer routes covering the entire province of Abra and out, while tricycles serve only the inner arteries of the municipality's barangays including the adjacent towns of Pidigan, Tayum and Peñarrubia on a chartered ride basis.

Buses going to Manila have their own permanent station/terminal, while all the rest are accomodated and parked along various open lots, gasoline stations, etc.
